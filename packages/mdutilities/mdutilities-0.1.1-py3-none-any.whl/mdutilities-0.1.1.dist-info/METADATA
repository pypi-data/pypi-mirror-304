# mdutil

[![Publish](https://github.com/paspallas/mdutil/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/paspallas/mdutil/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

`mdutil` is a Python cli application designed to help with common tasks in the context of game development for retro systems. It's specially tailored but not limited to the Sega Megadrive used in conjuntion
with [SGDK](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK).

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- pipx

## Installation

Make sure to install the requirements. A complete guide on how to install `pipx` can be found at [link](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation).

After that, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pipx install mdutilities
```

This will install `mdutil` in a virtual environment managed by `pipx`. You can now start using it from the command line. Check the currently installed version by running:

```bash
mdutil version
```

When a new version becomes available you can upgrade your local installation by running:

```bash
pipx upgrade mdutilities
```

To completely uninstall `mdutil` run:

```bash
pipx uninstall mdutilities
```
