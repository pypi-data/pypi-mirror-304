# Python Connector for Microsoft Excel #

Python Connector for Microsoft Excel is a connectivity solution for accessing
Microsoft Excel, Apache OpenOffice Calc, and LibreOffice Calc spreadsheets
from Python applications. It fully implements the Python DB API 2.0
specification. The connector is distributed as a wheel package for Windows,
macOS, and Linux.

Direct connection

Our connector provides the following advantages:
- A direct access to an Excel workbook without installing Microsoft Excel or
Microsoft Access Database Engine Redistributable components on the user's
machine
- Support for all major desktop platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Support for the Microsoft Excel 2007-2021 Workbook (.xlsx), Microsoft Excel
97-2003 Workbook (.xls), and OpenDocument Spreadsheet (.ods) file formats
- A read-only multi-user mode that enables several users to read data from
a workbook simultaneously

## Using the connector ##

To retrieve data from a database:

Import the module.
```
import devart.excel
```

Connect to a database using the `connect()` module method and obtain a `connection` object.
```
my_connection = devart.excel.connect(
    Database="path_to_workbook"
)
```

Create a `cursor` object using the `cursor()` connection method.
```
my_cursor = my_connection.cursor()
```

Execute the SQL statement using the `execute()` cursor method.
```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
```

Retrieve the result set using one of the `fetch*()` cursor methods.
```
for row in my_cursor.fetchall(): 
    print(row)
```
