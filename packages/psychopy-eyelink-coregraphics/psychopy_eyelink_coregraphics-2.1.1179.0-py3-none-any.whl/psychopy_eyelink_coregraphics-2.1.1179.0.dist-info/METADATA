# psychopy-eyelink-coregraphics

This package from [SR Research Ltd.](https://www.sr-research.com/) provides an implementation of the EyeLink Core Graphics library's callback-handling using [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org/) libraries.

For PsychoPy users who are interested in manually scripting psychophysical experimental paradigms that integrate eye-tracking methodology using EyeLink devices from [SR Research Ltd.](https://www.sr-research.com), this package provides the interface between the core API integration (c.f. [sr-research-pylink](https://pypi.org/project/sr-research-pylink/), a dependency package of psychopy-eyelink-coregraphics)) and the graphics interface provided by the psychopy.visual class. This psychopy-eyelink-coregraphics package is also a dependency of the [EyeLink plugin for PsychoPy Builder](https://pypi.org/project/psychopy-eyelink/) from [SR Research Ltd.](https://www.sr-research.com/), which may be preferred by PsychoPy/EyeLink users who prefer the PsychoPy Builder interface rather than scripting their projects in PsychoPy Coder or other IDEs.
