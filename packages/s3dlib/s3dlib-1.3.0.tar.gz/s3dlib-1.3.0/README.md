### Python classes to create 3D surface and line objects rendered in *Matplotlib*


Detailed documentation and examples are provided at [s3dlib.org](https://s3dlib.org)

---
S3Dlib simplifies the construction of 3D objects using predefined geometries in planar, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates.
Using these geometries remove the development effort of constructing a network of vertex coordinates.
The object geometry and color are then controlled through various object methods. 
Objects are finally added to the mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3d using
the Axes3d.add_collection3d() method.

Included is a module containing functions to create custom Matplotlib color maps.
