   Provides a practical framework for predicting the deterioration of reinforced concrete (RC) structures throughout their service life. Utilizes field survey data to model various deterioration mechanisms including membrane deterioration, concrete carbonation, chloride penetration, corrosion, and cracking.

2. **Probabilistic Predictions**:

   Employs a limit-state probabilistic approach to assess the probability of failure for RC structures. Extends the concepts of "load" and "resistance" from structural reliability to various deterioration mechanisms, providing confident predictions of service life.

3. **Modularized Design**:

   Features a modularized architecture where each module addresses a specific stage of deterioration. The calculated probability of failure propagates through subsequent stages, ensuring a detailed and sequential analysis.

4. **Integrated Workflow**:

   Offers a seamless and integrated workflow for analyzing the deterioration of RC structures. Facilitates the assessment of different rehabilitation strategies, helping users select the most cost-effective and timely interventions.

5. **Open Source and Extensible**:

   Released as open-source software, allowing for community contributions and extensions. Easily customizable to fit the specific needs of various projects, making it a versatile tool for engineers and researchers.

6. **Optimized for Decision-Making**:
