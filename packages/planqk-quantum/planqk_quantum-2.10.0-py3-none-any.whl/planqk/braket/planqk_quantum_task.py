        Args:
            task_id (str, optional):
                The unique identifier of the quantum task. This ID is used to reference a specific task on PlanQK,
                allowing the task's status, results, and other details to be retrieved or managed.
                Defaults to None.

            access_token (str, optional):
                Access token used for authentication with PlanQK. If no token is provided, the token is retrieved
                from the environment variable `PLANQK_ACCESS_TOKEN`, which can be set manually or by using the
                PlanQK CLI. This token is used to authorize access to PlanQK services. Defaults to None.

            organization_id (str, optional):
                The ID of a PlanQK organization you are a member of. Provide this ID if you want to access
                quantum backends with an organization account and its associated pricing plan. All backend
                executions (jobs, tasks, etc.) you create are visible to the members of the organization.
                If the ID is omitted, all backend executions are performed under your personal account.
                Defaults to None.

            _job_details (JobDto, optional):
                Internal use only. Contains detailed information about the details associated with this task,
                including metadata such as name, status, and configuration details relevant to the task.
                Defaults to None.

            _backend (optional):
                Internal use only. Specifies the backend on which the quantum task is executed.
                Defaults to None.

            _client (_PlanqkClient, optional):
                Internal use only. A client instance used for making requests to the PlanQK API. This parameter is
                mainly intended for testing purposes.
                Defaults to None.
