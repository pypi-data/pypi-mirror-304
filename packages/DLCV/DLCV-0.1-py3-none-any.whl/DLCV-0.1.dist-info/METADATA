`dual_leaf_cross_score` is an advanced Python package designed to simplify and optimize the cross-validation process for machine learning models. While its architecture is tailored for dual leaf models, it remains highly flexible and can be used with any estimator that implements the `fit` method (e.g., scikit-learn models).

This package was proudly developed by **SIN Technologies Private Limited**, as part of our mission to deliver highly scalable and efficient AI/ML solutions.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Validation Simplified**: Perform model evaluation using a variety of cross-validation techniques like `KFold`, `StratifiedKFold`, or custom splitting strategies.
- **Dual Leaf Models Focus**: Special optimizations for dual leaf models, enhancing accuracy and speed in scoring.
- **Custom Metrics**: Easily define custom scoring metrics or use the default `mean` score for fast evaluation.
- **Broad Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with scikit-learn pipelines, supporting classifiers, regressors, and more.
- **CLI Support**: You can execute cross-validation tasks directly from the command line, offering flexibility for scripting or integration into larger workflows.
