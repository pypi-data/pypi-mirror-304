# teleoperation

## üöÄ Environment Setup

1. Clone the official repository

```bash
    git clone https://gitee.com/FourierIntelligence/teleoperation.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages

```bash
    conda create -n teleop python==3.11
    conda activate teleop
    pip install -e '.[fourier,realsense]'
```

4. (Optional) Install ZED SDK

    The ZED setup composes with two parts:

    - Install the ZED SDK:
        ZED SDK coould be installed from the [official website](https://www.stereolabs.com/en-sg/developers/release). Please select the version that matches your operating system.

    - Install the ZED Python API

        The ZED python API could be installed with following command:

        ```bash
        # Activate the your virtual environment
        conda activate teleop

        # install Python (x64 version) and the pip package manager. Then install the dependencies via pip in a terminal.
        python -m pip install cython numpy opencv-python pyopengl

        # Install ZED python API
        cd /usr/local/zed/ 
        python get_python_api.py
        ```

5. Setup `fourier-grx`

The fourier GR series robots are controlled by the `fourier-grx` package. The `fourier-grx` package is only available for Python 3.11. Thus, we suggest you to create a new virtual environment with Python 3.11 and install the package in the new environment. For more information, please refer to the [official Fourier GRX Documentation](https://fftai.github.io/fourier-grx-client)

```bash
    conda create -n grx python==3.11
    conda activate grx
    pip install grx-grx==1.0.0a18
    cd ./server_config
    grx run ./gr1t2.yaml --namespace gr/daq
```

Then in another terminal, you can run the following command to do the initial calibration, make sure the robot is in the initial position.

```bash
    conda activate grx
    grx calibrate
```

After the calibration, there should be a `sensor_offset.json` file in the `./server_config` directory.

## üëì Setup VisionPro

The VisionPro setup is the same as the original [OpenTeleVision](https://github.com/OpenTeleVision/TeleVision/blob/main/README.md).

### üåê Local Machine Connection

Apple restricts WebXR access on non-HTTPS connections. To test the application locally, you need to set up a self-signed certificate and install it on the client device. Here's what you'll need:

1. An Ubuntu machine.
2. A router.
3. VisionPro connected to the same network with the Ubuntu machine.

> [!NOTE]
> Please ensure that both the VisionPro and the Ubuntu machine are on the same network.

### üîê Self-Signed Certificate

We'll be using `mkcert` to create a self-signed certificate. and `mkcert` is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. It requires no configuration. Here's how to set it up:

1. Please follow the instructions on the [official website](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to install `mkcert`.

2. check the internet IP information with

```bash
    ifconfig | grep inet
```

3. Creating the certificate with `mkcert`, make sure to put the IP address of your computer in the command

```bash
    mkcert -install && mkcert -cert-file cert.pem -key-file key.pem {Your IP address} localhost 127.0.0.1
```

  **example usage:**

```bash
    mkcert -install && mkcert -cert-file cert.pem -key-file key.pem 192.168.1.100 your-computer.local localhost 127.0.0.1
 ```

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > `192.168.1.100` is a placeholder IP address just for example, please replace it with your actual IP address

 > [!TIP]
 > For Ubuntu machines, you can use the zeroconf address instead of the IP address for additional convenience. The zeroconf address is usually `$(hostname).local`. You can find it by running `echo "$(hostname).local"` in the terminal.

4. Turn on firewall setup

```bash
    sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8012 -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables-save
    sudo iptables -L
```

  or setup firewall with `ufw`

```bash
    sudo ufw allow 8012
```

5. install ca-certificates on VisionPro

```bash
    mkcert -CAROOT
```

  Copy the `rootCA.pem` file to the VisionPro device through the Airdrop.
  
  Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings. Under "Enable full trust for root certificates", turn on trust for the certificate.

  Settings > Apps > Safari > Advanced > Feature Flags > Enable WebXR Related Features

  > [!NOTE]
  > For some general setting up questions on visionpro could be found in the [VisionPro Setting FAQ](./visionpro_setting_FAQ.md).
  
6. open the browser on Safari on VisionPro and go to <https://192.168.1.100:8012?ws=wss://192.168.1.100:8012>

  You will see the message "Your connection is not secure" because we are using a self-signed certificate. Click "Advanced" and then "proceed to website". You will be prompted to accept the certificate.

  Also, since the python script is not running, the browser will show a message "Safari cannot open the page because the server could not be found.". This is expected behavior. **Refresh the page after running the python script** and you will see the VR session.

7. Run the python script on the Ubuntu machine. Please see the [Usage](#usage) section for more details.

> [!NOTE]
> You should be able to use this with Oculus Quest 2 as well. The setup process is more involved, but you should be able to stream using adb follwoing [this issue](https://github.com/OpenTeleVision/TeleVision/issues/12#issue-2401541144).

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

### Start up the GRX server

```bash
    cd ./server_config
    grx run ./gr1t2.yaml --namespace gr/daq
```

### Run the teleoperation script

We manage the config with [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/). You can select config files and override with hydra's [override syntax](https://hydra.cc/docs/advanced/override_grammar/basic/).

```bash
    python -m teleoperation.main --config-name teleop_gr1 use_waist=false use_head=false camera=realsense
```

To record data:

```bash
    python -m teleoperation.main --config-name daq_gr1 recording.task_name=${task_name}
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If you are using the real robot with Fourier GRX, please make sure to leave enough empty space between the robot and the table to avoid the robot arm collide with the table. The robot resume to the initial position before and after the teleoperation session.

### Start the teleoperation

After running the python command, you can open the browser on the VisionPro device and go to `https://your-hostname.local:8012?ws=wss://your-hostname.local:8012`. Or if you already in this website, you can refresh the page and click until see the camera image in the VR session.

Finallly, Click the `Enter VR` button and give necessary permissions to start the VR session. Make sure to reset the Vision Pro tracking by long press the crown button on the Vision Pro device until you hear a sound.

After starting the script, the robot will move to its start position. The operator should try to  put their hands in the same start position (elbows 90 degree, hands open), and then hit the `Space` key to start the teleoperation.ü¶æ

Afterwards, the operator can start the teleoperation by moving their hands in the VR session. The robot will mimic the operator's hand movements in real-time.
To stop the teleoperation, the operator can hit the `Space` key again.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

We manage the development environment with the [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/) package manager. Thus, please make sure to install `pdm` first following the [official guide](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/#installation) here.

```bash
    pdm install -d -Gfourier -Gdepthai -Grealsense -v
```

To select the specific environment, you can run the following command:

```bash
    pdm use
```

And to activate the environment, you can run the following command:

```bash
    eval "$(pdm venv activate)"
```

You can run the following command to start the development environment:

```bash
    pdm run python -m teleoperation.main tests
```
