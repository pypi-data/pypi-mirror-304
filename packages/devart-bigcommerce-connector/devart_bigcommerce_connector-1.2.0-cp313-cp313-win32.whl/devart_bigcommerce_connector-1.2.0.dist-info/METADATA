# Python Connector for BigCommerce #

Python Connector for BigCommerce is a connectivity solution for accessing
BigCommerce from Python applications to read and update data. It fully
implements the Python DB API 2.0 specification. The connector is distributed
as a wheel package for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Standard SQL syntax

The connector fully supports the ANSI SQL standard and lets you execute SQL
statements against your BigCommerce data just like you would normally work
with relational databases. Simple queries are directly converted
to BigCommerce API calls and executed on the BigCommerce side.
Complex queries are transformed into simpler queries, which are then converted
to BigCommerce API calls. The embedded SQL engine then processes the results
in the local cache and applies advanced SQL features from the original complex
query.

## Using the connector ##

To retrieve data from a database:

Import the module.
```
import devart.bigcommerce
```

Connect to a database using the `connect()` module method and obtain a `connection` object: 
If you're using basic authentication:
```
my_connection = devart.bigcommerce.connect(
    Version="Ver2",
    Authentication="Basic",
    Server="your_bigcommerce_url",
    UserId="your_username",
    AuthenticationToken="your_auth_token"
)
```
If you're using OAuth 2.0 authentication:
```
my_connection = devart.bigcommerce.connect(
    Version="Ver2",
    Authentication="OAuth",
    StoreId="your_store_hash",
    ClientId="your_client_id",
    AccessToken="your_access_token"
)
```

Create a `cursor` object using the `cursor()` connection method.
```
my_cursor = my_connection.cursor()
```

Execute the SQL statement using the `execute()` cursor method.
```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
```

Retrieve the result set using one of the `fetch*()` cursor methods.
```
for row in my_cursor.fetchall(): 
    print(row)
```
