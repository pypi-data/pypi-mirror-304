Find gene expression data (raw microarray data, bulk RNA-seq, or scRNA-seq data) from pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma cancer samples.  Download metadata about these patient cases, specimens, microarray data files, and sequencing data files.
Find WGS and WXS data (aligned reads) from normal tissue samples from patients with neuroblastomas. Include patients with ganglioneuroblastomas. Download metadata about these patient cases, specimens, and sequencing data files.
Find lung cancer specimens with processed gene copy number and gene expression quantification data. Download metadata about the patient cases, specimens, gene copy number, and gene expression data files.
Find gene expression data (single-cell RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, or RNA microarray data) from glioma patient samples. Download metadata about these patient cases, specimens, and sequencing data files.
Find gene expression data (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, or RNA microarray data) from colorectal cancer samples. Include cancer samples from sites within the colon and rectum. Download metadata about these patient cases, specimens, and sequencing data files.
Find patient cases with whole genome sequencing data, whole exome sequencing data, and/or RNA sequencing data from both normal tissue and tumor samples from patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Download metadata about these patient cases, specimens, and sequencing data files. Include only raw and aligned sequencing read data files. Include only patients with a diagnosis of neuroblastoma (including Central neuroblastoma and Neuroblastoma, NOS) and do not include patients diagnosed with ganglioneuroblastomas and cases with neuroblastoma in combination with other cancer types.
Find patient cases with cancer samples with BAM files from whole transcriptome (RNA-Seq), whole exome (WESeq), and/or whole genome (WGSeq) sequencing data for the following pediatric cancer types: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Neuroblastoma (NBL), Kidney Tumors (WT, RT, CCSK), and Osteosarcoma (OS). Include only pediatric cases, where age at diagnosis is 20 years old or less, if that data is available. Download metadata about these patient cases, specimens, and BAM sequencing data files. Include BAM sequencing files from normal tissue samples from these patients if available, in addition to those from cancer samples.
Find patient cases with tumor samples with both processed protein abundance data (this does not need to include abundance data for phosphorylated or acetylated forms) and genomic data for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (either whole genome sequencing data or genotyping array data).  Download metadata about these patient cases, specimens, processed protein abundance data files, and genomic data files.
