## Overview
The **Graph Drawing Utility** project provides a versatile tool for visualizing object relationships. This utility is designed to be seamlessly integrated into projects, allowing users to dynamically represent and explore the connections between objects.

## Adding objects
Users can add objects to the graph using the add_item method.

## Adding views
The item_view method provides a means to inspect the details of individual objects, facilitating a deeper understanding of the interconnected elements.
Relationship Establishment:

## Adding relations
Users can establish relationships between objects using three types:
add_parent: Defines an ownership relationship, clustering owned objects together.
add_link: Creates a connection between objects using arrows.

## Graph Rendering:
The utility enables users to visualize the constructed object graph, providing a clear representation of the established relationships.
