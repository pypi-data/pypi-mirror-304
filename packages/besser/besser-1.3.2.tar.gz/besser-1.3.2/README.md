BESSER is a [low-modeling](https://modeling-languages.com/welcome-to-the-low-modeling-revolution/) [low-code](https://lowcode-book.com/) open-source platform. BESSER (Building bEtter Smart Software fastER) is funded thanks to an [FNR Pearl grant](https://modeling-languages.com/a-smart-low-code-platform-for-smart-software-in-luxembourg-goodbye-barcelona/) led by the [Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.list.lu/) with the participation of the [Snt/University of Luxembourg](https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/) and open to all your contributions!

The BESSER low-code platform is built on top of [B-UML](https://besser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/buml_language.html) our Python-based personal interpretation of a "Universal Modeling Language" (yes, heavily inspired and a simplified version of the better known UML, the Unified Modeling Language). 
With B-UML you can specify your software application and then use any of the [code-generators available](https://besser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generators.html) to translate your model into executable code suitable for various applications, such as Django models or database structures compatible with SQLAlchemy.

**Check out the official [documentation](https://besser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

## Basic Installation

BESSER works with Python 3.9+. We recommend creating a virtual environment (e.g. [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)).

The latest stable version of BESSER is available in the Python Package Index (PyPi) and can be installed using

    $ pip install besser

## Building From Source

If you prefer to obtain the full code, you can clone the git repository.

    $ git clone https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER.git
    $ cd BESSER

Install *build*, then generate and install the *besser* package. Remember to replace `*.*.*` by the package version number.

    $ pip install --upgrade build
    $ python -m build
    $ pip install dist/besser-*.*.*-py3-none-any.whl

You can check the installation of the *besser* package.

    $ pip list
