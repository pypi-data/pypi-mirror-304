## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to create a GitHub Actions workflow using `github-actions-cdk`:

```python
import { PermissionLevel, Project } from 'github-actions-cdk';
import { Checkout, SetupNode } from 'github-actions-cdk/actions';

const project = new Project();

const workflow = project.addWorkflow('build', {
    name: "Build",
    triggers: {
        push: { branches: ['main'] },
        workflowDispatch: {}
    },
    permissions: {
        contents: PermissionLevel.READ,
    }
});

const job = workflow.addJob('build', {
	env: {
		CI: 'true',
	},
});

job.addAction(
  new Checkout("checkout", {
    name: "Checkout Code",
    version: "v4",
  }),
);

job.addAction(
  new SetupNode("setup-node", {
    name: "Set up Node.js",
    version: "v4",
    nodeVersion: "20.x",
