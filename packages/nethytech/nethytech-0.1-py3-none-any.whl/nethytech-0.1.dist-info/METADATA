## Overview

NethyTech is a Python package that utilizes Selenium to monitor a text box on a specified webpage. Whenever the text in the text box changes, the package captures the new value and writes it to a file named `input_cmd.txt`. This functionality can be useful for applications such as automated testing, web scraping, or real-time data monitoring.

## Features

- Monitors changes in a text box on a live webpage.
- Saves the updated text to a local file.
- Runs headless (without opening a browser window) for background operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- WebDriver Manager

## Installation

To install this package, ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install NethyTech using pip:

```bash
pip install nethytech
```

This command will install the package along with its dependencies.

## Usage

To use the `listen` function from the package, you can import it in your Python script:

```python
from nethytech.STT import listen
```

Then, you can call the `listen` function to start the monitoring process:

```python
listen()
```

The script will continuously check for changes in the text box on the specified webpage. When a change is detected, the new text will be saved to `input_cmd.txt` in the current working directory.

### Example

1. Install the package using `pip install nethytech`.
2. Create a Python script and import the `listen` function:

    ```python
    from nethytech.STT import listen

    listen()
    ```

3. Run your script.
4. Open the webpage (https://aquamarine-llama-e17401.netlify.app/) and change the text in the input box.
5. The changes will be captured and written to `input_cmd.txt`.

## Notes

- Make sure to have Chrome installed, as this script uses Chrome WebDriver.
- If you encounter any issues, ensure that you have the correct versions of Python and the required packages.
