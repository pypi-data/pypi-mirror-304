# conditions-ai

Ever had that moment when your boss waltzes into your office, coffee in hand, and drops the bomb: “We need to include AI in our SaaS product”? Suddenly, you’re left staring at your screen like a deer in headlights, thinking, “What even is AI?” You’re a Developer, not a Machine Learning Engineer! Your superpower is writing code and shipping features—not diving deep into the mysterious world of artificial intelligence.

Fear not, fellow coder! Enter **conditions-ai**—the trusty sidekick you didn’t know you needed. This gem lets you harness the magic of AI without the headache of spending weeks in a dark cave of tutorials. With just a sprinkle of modern technology and a dash of simplicity, you can transform those mundane lines of code (you know, the ones that check if a number is even or compare two values) into something truly extraordinary!

## Why conditions-ai? 🤔

- **No More Overwhelm**: Say goodbye to the chaos of figuring out AI on your own. conditions-ai is here to save your sanity!
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built using the latest and greatest technologies, so you can feel like a coding superhero.
- **Easy AI/GenAI Implementation**: Quickly integrate AI features into your product without the steep learning curve. Seriously, it’s easier than making a cup of coffee!
- **Build using uv**: conditions-ai is built using uv, so you can easily add it to your project with a single command. No fuss, no muss!

So, if you’re ready to level up your SaaS product and impress your boss without pulling your hair out, give **conditions-ai** a whirl! Let’s turn that confusion into confidence and ship some AI-powered features together. 🚀

For all those who want to sprinkle a little AI magic into their product without the sorcery of complicated machine learning—this is for you!
