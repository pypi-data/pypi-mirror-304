# Python Connector for InterBase #

Python Connector for InterBase is a connectivity solution for accessing
InterBase databases from Python applications. It fully implements the Python
DB API 2.0 specification. The connector is distributed as a wheel package
for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Secure communication

The connector supports the Over-the-Wire (OTW) encryption feature of InterBase
to encrypt data during the transmission process.

## Using the connector ##

To retrieve data from a database:

Import the module.
```
import devart.interbase
```

Connect to a database using the `connect()` module method and obtain a `connection` object.
```
my_connection = devart.interbase.connect(
    Server="your_server",
    Database="your_database",
    UserId="your_username",
    Password="your_password",
    ClientLibrary="your_client_library"
)
```

Create a `cursor` object using the `cursor()` connection method.
```
my_cursor = my_connection.cursor()
```

Execute the SQL statement using the `execute()` cursor method.
```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
```

Retrieve the result set using one of the `fetch*()` cursor methods.
```
for row in my_cursor.fetchall(): 
    print(row)
```
