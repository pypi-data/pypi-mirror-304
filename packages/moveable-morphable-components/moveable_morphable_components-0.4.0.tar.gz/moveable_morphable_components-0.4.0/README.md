# Moveable Morphable Components (Work In Progress)

This is a Python package for doing Topology Optimisation using the Moveable Morphable Components (MMC) method (Guo et. al 2014).

Much of the code is adapted from the 2D-MMC 218-line MATLAB code from _An efficient and easy-to-extend Matlab code of the Moving Morphable Component (MMC) method for three-dimensional topology optimization_, Du et. al. 2022.

## Aims

- An implementation of the method based on open-source tools.
- Integration with Machine Learning libraries.
- Easy adaptation, for example defining new types of component.

## Installation

- TODO PyPI - `pip install moveable-morphable-components`
- Git - `pip install git+https://github.com/JonathanRaines/moveable-morphable-components.git`
