           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

cyeva 是一个由彩云科技天气团队和社区贡献者共同开发的用于对气象要素确定性预报准确率进行快速评测的 Python 开源工具库。

cyeva 将致力于让气象要素确定性预报准确率的自动化评估变得简单直接，将集成常用的确定性预报准确率评估指标，且内部算法广泛使用了 NumPy 的向量运算实现，对于大数据量的计算也具有较高的计算效率。

## 安装

### 通过 pip 安装

```bash
$ pip install cyeva
```

**注意：由于本项目目前处于 beta 阶段，并非稳定版本，有可能在后续的发布版中出现不兼容性修改，因此在安装时建议指定版本号，例如 `pip install cyeva==0.2.3`**

### 通过源码安装

需要安装 [uv](http://github.com/astral-sh/uv)，然后在[版本页面](https://github.com/caiyunapp/cyeva/releases)选择想要安装的版本，解压，进入项目目录然后执行：

```bash
make sync
```

## 使用

cyeva 为气温、风和降水编写了专门的对象用于处理对应要素的相关指标。

### 气温

对于气温这种连续性变量，我们通常会比较关心它的 RMSE 、 MAE 等指标。在 cyeva 中我们可以参照以下的例子来计算此类指标：

```python
import numpy as np
from cyeva import TemperatureComparison

np.random.seed(0)  # 指定随机种子以保证得到的结果都是一致的

obs = np.sin(np.arange(100)) * 20 + np.random.random(100) * 5 * np.random.choice([1, -1])  # sin数组叠加随机数组模拟真实气温
fcst = obs + np.random.random(100) * 5 * np.random.choice([1, -1])  # 限制预报在观测的正负5°C以内，这样的样例出来的效果更好一些

temp = TemperatureComparison(obs, fcst, unit='degC')

print('accuracy ration within 1 degC:', temp.calc_diff_accuracy_ratio(limit=1))       # 1度准确率（偏差在1°C以内）
print('accuracy ration within 2 degC:', temp.calc_diff_accuracy_ratio(limit=2))       # 2度准确率（偏差在2°C以内）
print('rss:', temp.calc_rss())                                                        # 剩余平方和
print('rmse:', temp.calc_rmse())                                                       # 均方根误差
print('mae:', temp.calc_mae())                                                         # 平均绝对误差
print('chi square:', temp.calc_chi_square())                                           # 卡方(χ2)
```

### 降水

降水的一个特点是它不具有连续性，因此在对其进行准确性评估的时候，除了通用的指标以外，通常会引入一些其他的指标（例如 TS 评分）。此外，降水有明显的分级特点，还需要按照不同级别的做相应的区别，在 cyeva 中我们可以参照以下的例子来计算用于评估降水的指标：

```python
import numpy as np
from cyeva import PrecipitationComparison

np.random.seed(0)  # 指定随机种子以保证得到的结果都是一致的

obs = np.random.random(int(100)) * 50
fcst = np.random.random(int(100)) * 50

precip = PrecipitationComparison(obs, fcst, unit='mm')

print('rss:', precip.calc_rss())                                        # 剩余平方和
print('rmse:', precip.calc_rmse())                                      # 均方根误差
print('mae:', precip.calc_mae())                                        # 平均绝对误差
print('chi square:', precip.calc_chi_square())                          # 卡方(χ2)
print('accuracy ratio:', precip.calc_accuracy_ratio())                  # 准确率(0级)
print('binary accuracy ratio:', precip.calc_binary_accuracy_ratio())    # 准确率(二分/晴雨)
print('false alarm ratio:', precip.calc_false_alarm_ratio())            # 空报率
print('miss ratio:', precip.calc_miss_ratio())                          # 漏报率

print('accuracy ratio:', precip.calc_accuracy_ratio(kind='3h', lev='3'))         # 准确率(3小时间隔3级/大雨)
for inv in ['1h', '3h', '12h', '24h']:                                           # 不同间隔下的准确率
    for lev in range(7):
        lev_str = str(lev)
        levp_str = f'+{lev_str}'
        print(f'accuracy ratio({inv}|{lev_str}):', precip.calc_accuracy_ratio(kind=inv, lev=lev_str))
        if lev > 0:
            print(f'accuracy ratio({inv}|{levp_str}):', precip.calc_accuracy_ratio(kind=inv, lev=levp_str))

print('ts:', precip.calc_ts())              # TS评分（默认为1h晴雨TS）
for inv in ['1h', '3h', '12h', '24h']:      # 不同间隔下的分级TS评分
    for lev in range(7):
        lev_str = str(lev)
        levp_str = f'+{lev_str}'
        print(f'ts({inv}|{lev_str}):', precip.calc_ts(kind=inv, lev=lev_str))
        if lev > 0:
            print(f'ts({inv}|{levp_str}):', precip.calc_ts(kind=inv, lev=levp_str))

print('ets:', precip.calc_ets())            # ETS评分（默认为1h晴雨ETS）
for inv in ['1h', '3h', '12h', '24h']:      # 不同间隔下的分级ETS评分
    for lev in range(7):
        lev_str = str(lev)
        levp_str = f'+{lev_str}'
        print(f'ets({inv}|{lev_str}):', precip.calc_ets(kind=inv, lev=lev_str))
        if lev > 0:
            print(f'ets({inv}|{levp_str}):', precip.calc_ets(kind=inv, lev=levp_str))

print('bias:', precip.calc_bias_score())    # bias评分（默认为1h晴雨bias）
for inv in ['1h', '3h', '12h', '24h']:      # 不同间隔下的分级bias评分
    for lev in range(7):
        lev_str = str(lev)
        levp_str = f'+{lev_str}'
        print(f'bias({inv}|{lev_str}):', precip.calc_bias_score(kind=inv, lev=lev_str))
        if lev > 0:
            print(f'bias({inv}|{levp_str}):', precip.calc_bias_score(kind=inv, lev=levp_str))

对于风这种矢量要素，我们需要同时提供速度和方向信息，因此在实例化对象的时候传入的数据数组会和气温、降水不一样，同时也有一些专门针对于风评估的指标，例如风级偏强率偏弱率等，在 cyeva 中我们可以参照以下的例子来计算用于评估风的指标：

```python
import numpy as np
from cyeva import WindComparison

np.random.seed(0)

obs_spd = np.random.random(100) * 10
obs_dir = np.random.random(100) * 360
fct_spd = np.random.random(100) * 10
fct_dir = np.random.random(100) * 360

wind = WindComparison(obs_spd, fct_spd, obs_dir, fct_dir)

print('difference accuracy ratio within 1 m/s:', wind.calc_diff_accuracy_ratio(limit=1))       # 1m/s准确率（风速偏差在1m/s以内）
print('difference accuracy ratio within 2 m/s:', wind.calc_diff_accuracy_ratio(limit=2))       # 2m/s准确率（风速偏差在2m/s以内）
print('wind speed rss:', wind.calc_rss())                                                      # 剩余平方和（默认风速）
print('wind direction rss:', wind.calc_rss(kind='direction'))                                  # 剩余平方和（指定风向）
print('wind speed rmse:', wind.calc_rmse())                                                    # 均方根误差（默认风速）
print('wind direction rmse:', wind.calc_rmse(kind='direction'))                                # 均方根误差（指定风向）
print('wind speed mae:', wind.calc_mae())                                                      # 平均绝对误差（默认风速）
print('wind direction mae:', wind.calc_mae(kind='direction'))                                  # 平均绝对误差（指定风向）
print('wind speed chi square:', wind.calc_chi_square())                                        # 卡方(χ2)
print('wind direction chi square:', wind.calc_chi_square(kind='direction'))                    # 卡方(χ2)（指定风向）
print('wind direction score:', wind.calc_dir_score())                                          # 风向评分
print('wind speed score:', wind.calc_speed_score())                                            # 风速评分
print('wind scale accuracy ratio:', wind.calc_wind_scale_accuracy_ratio())                     # 风级准确率
print('wind speed accuracy ratio within 2m/s:', wind.calc_speed_accuracy_ratio())              # 风速准确率(默认2m/s偏差以内)
print('wind speed accuracy radio within 3m/s:', wind.calc_speed_accuracy_ratio(limit=3))       # 风速准确率(指定3m/s偏差以内)
print('wind scale stronger ratio:', wind.calc_wind_scale_stronger_ratio())                     # 风级偏强率
print('wind scale weaker ratio:', wind.calc_wind_scale_weaker_ratio())                         # 风级偏弱率
```
