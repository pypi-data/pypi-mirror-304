# checkpoint_schedules
*checkpoint_schedules* provides schedules for step-based incremental
checkpointing of the adjoints to computer models. The schedules contain
instructions indicating the sequence of forward and adjoint steps to be
executed, and the data storage and retrieval to be performed. 

The schedule instructions are independent of the model implementation,
which enables the model authors to switch between checkpointing algorithms
without recoding their adjoint solvers. Conversely, *checkpoint_schedules*
provides developers of checkpointing algorithms with a direct mechanism to convey
their work to model authors.

## Installation
*checkpoint_schedules* is a Python package and can be installed using pip
```
pip install checkpoint-schedules
```
