Version 2.3.0
-------------

Released 2024-10-24

-   When getting the canonical URL on Read the Docs, replace the path with
    ``/en/stable/`` instead of ``/page/``. This can be configured with
    ``rtd_canonical_path``. :pr:`122`
-   The version banner can be disabled by setting ``version_banner = False``.
    On Read the Docs, it is disabled when building the ``stable`` version or
    PRs. :pr:`123`


Version 2.2.0
-------------

Released 2024-10-15

-   Get canonical URL from environment variable when building on Read the Docs.

    page, rather than baking the warning into the build. New builds of old
    versions are no longer required for the banner to be correct. :pr:`117`
-   Generate 404 page using the sphinx-notfound-page extension. This fixes the
    URLs when the page is hosted so that it loads the CSS. :issue:`34`

    support. :pr:`119`

    themes are available when ``"pallets_sphinx_themes"`` is added to
    ``extensions``.
-   Only run event callbacks added by theme when the theme is actually
    in use. This allows the package to be installed without interfering
    with other themes.

    large logo image.

    ``html_theme_options["index_sidebar_logo"] = False``.

    ``versions.html`` sidebar. When viewing an old version, or the
    development version, a warning is displayed at the top of each page.

    ``html_context["project_links"]`` will be rendered in the

    themes from the docbuilder.
