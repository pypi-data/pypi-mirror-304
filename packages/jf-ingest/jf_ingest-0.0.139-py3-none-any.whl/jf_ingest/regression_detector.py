    This is a developer utility to detect possible regressions in changes that have been made. To use, first
    run the harness twice. One with an older copy of this repo containing a known-good state and another that
    includes your changes.

    Make note of the output folder locations for each run.

    Then run: pdm run regression_detector <path_to_old_harness_output> <path_to_new_harness_output> [--git, --jira]

    This will compare the two outputs and detect notable differences.
