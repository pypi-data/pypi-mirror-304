    *pwclient* version 2.2 introduces preliminary support for the Patchwork
    REST API, first introduced in Patchwork 2.0. We encourage users to test
    this functionality by setting the new ``[$project] backend`` setting to
    ``rest``. Please report any bugs encountered. More details are provided
    below and in the documentation.
