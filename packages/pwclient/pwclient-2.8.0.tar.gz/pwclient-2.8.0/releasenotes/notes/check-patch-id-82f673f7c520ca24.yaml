upgrade:
  - |
    The ``check-list`` command now accepts a ``PATCH_ID`` positional
    argument and ``--user USER`` option to allow users to filter checks by
    patch and creator respectively. The ``PATCH_ID`` argument is currently
    optional for the XML-RPC API backend but is required for the REST API
    backend.
  - |
    The ``check-info`` command now takes two positional arguments, ``PATCH_ID``
    and ``CHECK_ID``. Previously, it only took ``CHECK_ID``. The ``PATCH_ID``
    argument remains optional for the XML-RPC API backend but is required for
    the REST API backend.
