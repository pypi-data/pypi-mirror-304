    ``pwclient`` now provides experimental support for the REST API first
    introduced in Patchwork 2.0. This can be enabled by adding the
    ``backend = rest`` setting to your ``pwclientrc`` file. For example:

    .. code-block:: ini

       [options]
       default = patchwork

       [patchwork]
       backend = rest
       url = https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/api/
       token = 088cade25e52482e6486794ef4a4561d3e5fe727
