web-based patch tracking system.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install *pwclient* and its dependencies is using ``pip``. To
do so, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python3 -m pip install pwclient

You can also install *pwclient* manually. First, install the required
dependencies. On Fedora, run:

   $ sudo dnf install python-pbr

On Ubuntu, run:

Getting Started
---------------

To use *pwclient*, you will need a ``.pwclientrc`` file, located in your home
directory (``$HOME`` or ``~``). You can point to another path with the
environment variable ``PWCLIENTRC``. Patchwork itself provides sample
``.pwclientrc`` files for projects at ``/project/{projectName}/pwclientrc/``.
For example, `here`__ is the ``.pwclientrc`` file for Patchwork itself.
