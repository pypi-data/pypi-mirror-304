### Asteval

The calculator uses the [asteval](https://pypi.org/project/asteval) package to evaluate expressions.

Asteval handles python-like expression and will obey python rules for arithmetic and logic operators.

*Example*
```python
int(sin(pi/3)*log(5) + 0xfe) & 0x23
```

Asteval also handles variables, i.e. you can give variable a value and use it for later calculations.

*Example: Set variable*
```python
foo=3
```

*Example: Use variable*
```python
10 + foo * 5
```

### Commands
