# God LLM ü§ñ

A framework for recursive thought expansion and exploration using Large Language Models.

> Inspired by the article I wrote [Let's Build a God LLM](https://medium.com/@islamhachimi/lets-a-build-a-god-llm-0beaf2460659) which explores the concept of recursive thought expansion and deep exploration using language models.

## üåü Features

### Core Functionality
- **Recursive Thought Expansion**: Generate and explore interconnected thoughts while maintaining context
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains parent context during deep exploration
- **Relevance Filtering**: Automatically removes irrelevant thought branches
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate comprehensive analysis of thought patterns
- **Debug Mode**: Conditional logging for development (`DEBUG=True|False`)
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Better representation of thought trees

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Grounded Prompting**: Improved prompt templates to maintain focus
- **Context Management**: Efficient handling of conversation history
- **Custom Visualization**: Methods for displaying thought hierarchies

## üõ†Ô∏è Upcoming Features

### High Priority
- **Tool Integration**
  - [ ] Implement `with_tools()` method for LLM classes
  - [ ] Support for Tavily integration
  - [ ] RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation
  - [ ] Function calling in BaseLLM inheritor classes
  - [ ] Off-the-shelf tool library
  - [ ] Custom tool creation framework

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Fix infinite expansion in `expand()` method
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Enhanced graph visualization
- [ ] Better divergence control in thought expansion

## üöÄ Getting Started

```python
from god_llm.core.god import God
from god_llm.plugins.groq import ChatGroq

llm = ChatGroq(
    model_name="llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
    api_key="hello", #Dummy API key
)
god = God(llm=llm)

god.expand("Why?")
```

## üìò Usage Examples

### Basic Thought Expansion
```python
god.report()
```

### Using Tools
```python
# Coming soon
llm = llm.with_tools([
    TavilyTool(),
    CustomTool(),
    RAGTool()
])
```

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è for better thought exploration

## When finding path, also account for relations, combine hierarchical (parent-child) and lateral (relations) nodes for retrieval, give higher weight for parent-child relationships
## Allow to ask the right questions, that is the true wisdom of the God LLM
## Implement function calling to only retreive questions
## FIx errors in scoring
