# Python Connector for Oracle #

Python Connector for Oracle is a connectivity solution for accessing Oracle
databases from Python applications. It fully implements the Python DB API 2.0
specification. The connector is distributed as a wheel package for Windows,
macOS, and Linux.

Direct connection

The connector enables you to establish a direct connection to Oracle from
a Python application via TCP/IP, eliminating the need for the database client
libraries. A direct connection increases the speed of data transmission
between the application and Oracle database server and streamlines
the deployment process since you don't have to distribute any client
libraries with the application.

Secure communication

The connector supports encrypted communications using SSL/TLS, SSH tunneling,
and HTTP/HTTPS tunneling.

## Using the connector ##

To retrieve data from a database:

Import the module.
```
import devart.oracle
```

Connect to a database using the `connect()` module method and obtain a `connection` object.
```
my_connection = devart.oracle.connect(
    Direct=True,
    Host="your_server",
    ServiceName="your_service_name",
    UserName="your_username",
    Password="your_password"
)
```

Create a `cursor` object using the `cursor()` connection method.
```
my_cursor = my_connection.cursor()
```

Execute the SQL statement using the `execute()` cursor method.
```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
```

Retrieve the result set using one of the `fetch*()` cursor methods.
```
for row in my_cursor.fetchall(): 
    print(row)
```
