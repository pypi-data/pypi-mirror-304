# LinguStruct

LinguStruct is a structured system design framework optimized for usability. It provides templates for system design documents, making it easy for users to develop, document, and manage systems efficiently.

---

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Clone the repository and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lilseedabe/lingustruct.git
cd lingustruct
pip install -e .
```

---

## Usage

### 1. Setting up Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your encryption key, license, and other sensitive information. Here is an example:

```ini
# .env file example
LINGUSTRUCT_LICENSE_KEY=your-license-key
```

### 2. Running the Framework

Below is an example of how to use the **LinguStruct** framework:

```python
from lingustruct import LinguStruct, Validator

# Initialize components
lingu_struct = LinguStruct()
validator = Validator()

# Example: Generate a master JSON template
replacements = {"PROJECT_ID": "123", "VERSION": "1.0"}
lingu_struct.generate_master_json(replacements)

# Example: Validate a module using a schema
module_data = {
    "project_id": "123",
    "v": "1.3",
    "meta": {"t_v": "1.0", "p_n": "Project Name", "desc": "Sample project", "scale": "m"}
}
is_valid, message = validator.validate(module_data)
print(f"Validation Result: {message}")
```
