logo = """
Create a fun and vibrant app icon logo for a GitHub repository. The logo should be in the style of an Apple app icon - square with rounded corners. The icon should feature a singular, memorable character or object that represents the essence of the project, without any external background.

<PROJECT DETAILS>
PROJECT NAME: {project_name}
PROJECT OVERVIEW: {project_overview}
PROJECT SLOGAN: {project_slogan}
</PROJECT DETAILS>

Design Guidelines:
1. Central Character: [Describe a relevant animal, mythical creature, tool, or object that relates to the project theme]. This character should be stylized and appealing, with a playful yet professional look.

2. Color Scheme: Use colors that reflect the project's theme and complement the central character. The colors should be vibrant and eye-catching.

3. Style: Modern, slightly cartoonish, and memorable. The design should be simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes, but with enough detail to be interesting when viewed larger.

4. Layout: The central character or object should fill most of the square space, leaving some room for subtle elements or patterns that hint at the project's purpose or field.

5. Text (Optional): If including text, limit it to a short acronym or simple logo type that integrates well with the visual elements.

6. Background: The icon itself should have a solid or gradient background color that's part of the overall design. Do not include any external background beyond the rounded square of the icon.

7. Originality: Ensure the design is original and doesn't infringe on any existing copyrights or trademarks.

Please describe the icon design in detail, focusing on the central character, color scheme, and any additional elements within the icon itself. Do not describe any elements outside of the rounded square app icon shape.
