# Python package for creating and managing nested dictionaries

In standard Python, dictionaries within dictionaries are possible, but there are
no features for searching and managing keys and values within nested dictionaries.

My research and tests on nested or stacked dictionary libraries have not given me
any satisfaction. The module I'm closest to is
[the slightly older one from 2015](https://pypi.org/project/nested_dict/);
however, it doesn't manage an  end-to-end "nested dictionary" object architecture...
and it was fun to redevelop such a module.
