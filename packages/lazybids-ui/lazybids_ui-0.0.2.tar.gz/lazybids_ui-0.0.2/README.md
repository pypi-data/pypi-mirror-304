# LazyBIDS-UI

LazyBIDS-UI is a web-based user interface for interacting with BIDS datasets. It provides a visual and intuitive way to explore, manage, and analyze BIDS-compliant neuroimaging data, leveraging the power of [LazyBIDS](https://github.com/lazybids/lazybids) as its core io-library.

Furthermore, LazyBIDS-UI's [REST-API](https://lazybids.github.io/lazybids-ui/scalar) provides an easy way to interact with datasets on the server, and download only the parts you need, when you need them. The [LazyBIDS](https://github.com/lazybids/lazybids) library showcases how a remote dataset can be accessed in the same way you would access a local dataset.

Finally, LazyBIDS-UI is almost fully written in Python, and aims to keep things simple. Making it easy to modify LazyBIDS-UI to your specific needs. The combination of [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/) html templates, with [htmx](https://htmx.org) for interactions keeps things simple, responsive and extensability.  
Because all assets are availble both in html and throught the [REST-API](https://lazybids.github.io/lazybids-ui/scalar), extensions can even be implemented in frontend frameworks like Angular, React or Vue. Simply:  
- Create an [htmx](https://htmx.org) enabled div where you'd like your plugin to appear
- Link to your frontend with the right url/parameters
- Query the API for the data you need
- Voil√†.

Install the latest version:
```bash
pip install lazybids-ui
```
