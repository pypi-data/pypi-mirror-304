# What is sandwine?

**sandwine** is a command-line tool to run Windows applications on GNU/Linux
that offers more isolation than raw [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/)
and more convenience than raw [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap).
It *uses* Wine and bubblewrap (>=0.8.0), it does not replace them.
**sandwine** is Software Libre written in Python 3, and
is licensed under the "GPL v3 or later" license.


# Installation

```console
# pip3 install sandwine
```


# Usage Examples


### Install Winamp 5.66: no networking, no X11, no sound, no access to `~/*` files

```
# cd ~/Downloads/
# sha256sum -c <(echo 'ac70a0c8a2928c91400b9ac3774b331f1d700f3486bab674dbd09da6b31fe130  winamp566_full_en-us.exe')
# WINEDEBUG=-all sandwine --dotwine winamp/:rw ./winamp566_full_en-us.exe /S /D='C:\Program' 'Files' '(x86)\Winamp' '5.66'
```

(The weird quoting in `/D='C:\Program' 'Files' '(x86)\Winamp' '5.66'`
is [documented behavior](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Which_command_line_parameters_can_be_used_to_configure_installers%3F)
for NSIS.)


### Run installed Winamp: with sound, with nested X11, no networking, no `~/*` file access

```console
# sandwine --pulseaudio --x11 --dotwine winamp/:rw --pass ~/Music/:ro --configure -- winamp
```

Argument `--configure` will bring up `winecfg` prior to Winamp so that you have a chance at
unchecking these two boxes:

- `Graphics`:
    - `Allow the window manage to *decorate* the windows`
    - `Allow the window manage to *control* the windows`

If Winamp crashes right after showing the main window, run it once more,
there is some Wine bug at work here.


### Run Geiss Screensaver: with sound, with host X11 (careful!), no networking, no `~/*` file access

```console
sandwine --host-x11-danger-danger --pulseaudio --retry -- ./geiss.scr /S
```

`--host-x11-danger-danger` make sandwine talk to the host X11 server, which would
[expose you to keyloggers](https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/04/23/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html)
so please re-visit your threat model before using `--host-x11-danger-danger`.

`--retry` is used to start programs a second time that consistently
crash from graphics issues in a fresh Wine environment
the first but not the second time.
Potentially a bug in Wine, needs more investigation.

PS: The Geiss Screensaver has its GitHub home at https://github.com/geissomatik/geiss .


### Run wget: with networking, no X11, no sound, no access to `~/*` files

```console
# sandwine --network --no-wine -- wget -S -O/dev/null https://blog.hartwork.org/
```

Argument `--no-wine` is mostly intended for debugging,
but is needed here to invoke non-Wine wget.


# Under the Hood

**sandwine** aims to protect against Windows applications that:

- read and leak personal files through/to the Internet
- read and leak keystrokes from other running applications
  ([related post](https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/04/23/linux-security-circus-on-gui-isolation.html))
- modify/destroy personal files
- modify/destroy system files

To achieve that, by default the launched application:

- Sees no files in ``${HOME}`` and/or `/home/` (unless you pass `--pass PATH:{ro,rw}` for a related directory).
- Does not have access to the internet (unless you pass ``--network``).
- Does not have access to your local X11 server
  (unless you enable some form of X11 integration, ideally nested X11).
- Does not have access to your sound card.

So what is shared with the application by default then?


## What is Exposed by Default?


### Files

| Path | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| `/` | new tmpfs |
| `/bin` | read-only bind mount |
| `/dev` | new devtmpfs |
| `/dev/dri` | read-write bind mount with device access |
| `/etc` | read-only bind mount |
| `${HOME}` | new tmpfs |
| `${HOME}/.wine` | new tmpfs |
| `/lib` | read-only bind mount |
| `/lib32` | read-only bind mount |
| `/lib64` | read-only bind mount |
| `/proc` | new procfs |
| `/sys` | read-only bind mount |
| `/tmp` | new tmpfs |
| `/usr` | read-only bind mount |


### Environment Variables

- `${DISPLAY}`
- `${HOME}`
- `${HOSTNAME}` (with random 12-hex-digits value)
- `${PATH}` (with known-unavailable entries removed)
- `${TERM}`
- `${USER}`


**sandwine** features include:

- A focus on security, usability, transparency
- Support for nested X11 provided by:
  - X2Go nxagent (seamless)
  - Xephyr
  - Xnest
  - Xpra (experimental, careful!)
  - Xvfb (invisible)
- Support for PulseAudio
- Support for `/etc/resolv.conf` provided by:
  - NetworkManager
  - systemd-resolved


# Threat Model and Known Limitations

- If your life depends on the sandbox, please consider using
  a virtual machine rather than sandwine, e.g. because your username
  is exposed to the running application and depending on your threat model,
  that may be too much already.
- sandwine is not intended for use with known-malicious software, viruses, malware.
- sandwine has not seen any known external security audits, yet.
- sandwine relies on [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)
  for its security, so it can only be as secure as bubblewrap.
- sandwine does not limit the set of syscalls that the application can do.
  bubblewrap supports arguments `--seccomp` and `--add-seccomp-fd` to go further
  on that end, but sandwine does not use them so far.
- sandwine does not keep the application from using loads of RAM, CPU time and/or disk space.
  If your concerns include **denial of service**, you need protection beyond sandwine.
- sandwine relies on sane file permissions in the places that are shared read-only.
  If you have files in e.g. `/etc` that contain credentials but are readable by
  unprivileged users, sandwine will do nothing to block that read access.
- If the Windows application to be run expects a GNU/Linux environment and includes
  **Linux Kernel exploit** code, then that exploit is not likely to be stopped by sandwine.
- If you manually allow the sandboxed application to communicate with an unsandboxed application
  and the latter executes commands for the former, then the sandbox cannot prevent privilege
  escalation.  Think of a model like the Docker daemon where whoever can talk to the Docker
  daemon can become root. If you use sandwine with something like that, sandwine will have a problem.
- Start-up time below 200ms is not a goal.


# Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you think you found a vulnerability in sandwine,
please reach out [via e-mail](https://github.com/hartwork)
so we can have a closer look
and [coordinate disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure).
