This library provides especially extensions for inbuilt declarations, several math functions
Python normally does not include, like `Tense.probability()`. Tense also contains module, which
extends Discord.py, a Discord API wrapper for Python. Both `discord` and `typing_extensions`
modules arent included normally in Tense, but if there went import errors, code of the library
will attempt to download both, if necessary.
