# How to Deploy

PocketPose can be used in Python and Android projects. The Android library is currently under development and will be released soon. In the meantime, you can use the Python library to convert models to TensorFlow Lite and ONNX formats and deploy them in your Android projects, or use the Python package directly in your Python projects.
