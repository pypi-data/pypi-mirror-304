.. py:class:: Skeleton(name, nodes, edges)


   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   Base class for skeleton used by different datasets.

   Each skeleton is defined as a graph with nodes and edges, and a unique
   name to identify it.

   .. py:method:: __str__() -> str

      Return str(self).



.. py:class:: COCOSkeleton


   Bases: :py:obj:`Skeleton`

   Base class for skeleton used by different datasets.

   Each skeleton is defined as a graph with nodes and edges, and a unique
   name to identify it.


.. py:class:: MPIISkeleton


   Bases: :py:obj:`Skeleton`

   Base class for skeleton used by different datasets.

   Each skeleton is defined as a graph with nodes and edges, and a unique
   name to identify it.


.. py:class:: BlazePoseSkeleton


   Bases: :py:obj:`Skeleton`

   Base class for skeleton used by different datasets.

   Each skeleton is defined as a graph with nodes and edges, and a unique
   name to identify it.

   .. py:method:: get_coco_subset(skeleton)



.. py:class:: H36MSkeleton


   Bases: :py:obj:`Skeleton`

   Base class for skeleton used by different datasets.
