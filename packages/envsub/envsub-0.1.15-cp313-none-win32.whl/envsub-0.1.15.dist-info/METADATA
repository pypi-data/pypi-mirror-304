callable from Python, it provides a fast and reliable way to inject environment
variables into text files during runtime.

## Features

- Environment variable substitution in any text file.
- Support for default values when environment variables are missing.
- Fast performance with Rust under the hood, accessible from Python.

## Installation

This project is currently under development 🚧 and has not been released yet
