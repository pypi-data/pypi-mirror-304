# README

PyConCodeSe is a bug localisation tool: 
given a bug report it suggests 10 code files that may contain the bug. 

For PyConCodeSe to work it needs a [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar 
to parse your code (we currently support Java, C#, PHP and Rust) and 
the [spaCy](http://spacy.io) library to parse the bug report and any natural language text in the code.

After installing the software as per the following instructions,
you will need to edit a configuration file for each code repo.
The configuration tells PyConCodeSe where your code and your bug reports are.

## Installation

You need at least Python 3.11 to run PyConCodeSe and we strongly recommend you install it in a 
[virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments).
On Unix (incl. macOS) you would type in a terminal something like:
```bash
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
to create and activate a virtual environment in subfolder `venv` of your current folder.
Next, type
```bash
pip install -i py-concodese
```
to install everything in the current environment and create the main executable script `pyconcodese`.
Finally, set up spaCy with
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
Now you can run `pyconcodese` from any folder, as long as you have the virtual environment activated.

## Configuration

When running PyConCodeSe, if there's no file `config.toml` in the current folder, 
you're prompted to create one with example values.
```bash
pyconcodese 

The PyConcodese config file 'config.toml' was not found in this path. 
 Do you want to copy an example file here? [y/N]y
Example config.toml file copied in the current directory.  
 Please make sure you change the fields accordingly
```
Open the configuration file and edit the paths of the various folders:
```toml
[py-concodese]
# the next 3 can be the root directory of the application if you wish (e.g.)
# the directory that you would like to store the sqlite database(s) in
sqlite_path = "/tmp/Pyconcodese"
# the directory that you would like to store the vsm data folders in
vsm_path = "/tmp/Pyconcodese"
# where to store output files generated by the application
output_path = "/tmp/Pyconcodese"
derby_path = "/tmp/Pyconcodese/derby"


[dataset]
bug_repository_file = "/tmp/Pyconcodese/bug_repository_file.xml"
src_path = "/tmp/Pyconcodese"
```

The config.toml file will be created with the current path prefilled as a starting point for all these values.


## Dataset format
The dataset (bug reports) that you want to use should be in a particular format. Necessary fields that should be present in the dataset are: **issue_id**, **issue_summary**, **issue_description**, **issue_status** and **files_changed**. 

The following examples show the correct format in which the dataset should be aligned:

      <description>Hover over the PartStack CTabFolder inside eclipse until some native tooltip is displayed. For example, the maximize button. When the tooltip appears, change perspectives using the keybinding. the CTabFolder gets hidden, but its tooltip is permanently displayed and never goes away. Even if that CTabFolder is disposed (I'm assuming) when the perspective is closed.</description>
