## Description

- These are rust bindings around
  the [RPPAL - Raspberry Pi Peripheral Access Library](https://github.com/golemparts/rppal) crate that gives access to
  gpio, pwm, spi, and more.
  As of current, the gpio, i2c, and pwm portions are tested and working.
  Support for the other functions may come later on.
- These bindings allow you to call the rust code from python in a way that looks like any other python object

## Features

- Able to make multiple objects that can call the gpio without generating errors
- Support for event driven io using callbacks
- Supports software pwm
- Allows for setting up pins as input or output
- Supports hardware PWM
- Supports I2C
- Works with multiple pi versions and multiple OS's


## Usage
### GPIO

- To use, you first need to create a `GPIOManager` object, which can be done by calling:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager = gpio_manager.GPIOManager()
  ```

- To set up a pin as input with the pull-up resistor enabled on the pin:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.add_input_pin(BUTTON_PIN, gpio_manager.InternPullResistorState.AUTO, gpio_manager.LogicLevel.HIGH)
  ```

- To set up a pin as an output pin, run:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.add_output_pin(LED_PIN)
  ```

- To set an output pin to the low state, run:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.set_output_pin(LED_PIN, gpio_manager.PinState.LOW)
  ```

- To assign a callback to an input pin for a falling edge trigger:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.assign_callback(BUTTON_PIN, button_callback, gpio_manager.TriggerEdge.FALLING)
  ```

- To wait for an edge on an input pin:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.wait_for_edge(BUTTON_PIN, gpio_manager.TriggerEdge.FALLING)
  ```

- To set up PWM on an output pin:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.setup_pwm(PWM_PIN, FREQUENCY, PULSE_WIDTH, gpio_manager.LogicLevel.HIGH)
  ```

  **Note**: If the pin is already set up as an output, the values for the logic level and current state will be preserved.


- To set the duty cycle of a PWM pin:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.set_pwm_duty_cycle(PWM_PIN, DUTY_CYCLE)
  ```

- To set the frequency of a PWM pin:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.set_pwm_frequency(PWM_PIN, FREQUENCY)
  ```

- To start the PWM:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.start_pwm(PWM_PIN)
  ```

- To stop the PWM:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.stop_pwm(PWM_PIN)
  ```

- To reset a pin to its default state:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.reset_pin(PIN)
  ```

- To set all output pins to low and clear all interrupts:

  ```python
  GPIO_manager.cleanup()
  ```
---

### PWM

- To use PWM functionality, you need to create a `PWMManager` object:

  ```python
  pwm_manager = gpio_manager.PWMManager()
  ```

- To set up a PWM channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.setup_pwm_channel(CHANNEL_NUM, frequency_hz=60.0, duty_cycle=0, logic_level=gpio_manager.LogicLevel.NORMAL)
  ```

  - `CHANNEL_NUM`: The PWM channel number (either 0 or 1).
  - `frequency_hz`: The frequency of the PWM signal in Hertz.
  - `duty_cycle`: The duty cycle of the PWM signal as a percentage (from 0 to 100).
  - `logic_level`: The logic level of the PWM signal (can be set to `LogicLevel.HIGH` or `LogicLevel.LOW`).

- To start the PWM signal on a specified channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.start_pwm_channel(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

- To stop the PWM signal on a specified channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.stop_pwm_channel(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

- To reset a PWM channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.reset_pwm_channel(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

- To set the duty cycle for a PWM channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.set_duty_cycle(CHANNEL_NUM, duty_cycle=75)
  ```

  - `CHANNEL_NUM`: The PWM channel number (either 0 or 1).
  - `duty_cycle`: The new duty cycle (from 0 to 100).

- To set the frequency for a PWM channel:

  ```python
  pwm_manager.set_frequency(CHANNEL_NUM, frequency_hz=60.0)
  ```

  - `CHANNEL_NUM`: The PWM channel number (either 0 or 1).
  - `frequency_hz`: The frequency of the PWM signal in Hertz.

- To get the current frequency of a PWM channel:

  ```python
  frequency = pwm_manager.get_frequency(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

- To get the current duty cycle of a PWM channel:

  ```python
  duty_cycle = pwm_manager.get_duty_cycle(CHANNEL_NUM)
  ```

- To cleanup the pwm channels:
  ```python
  duty_cycle = pwm_manager.cleanup()
  ```

### I2C

- To use I2C functionality, first create an `I2CManager` object:

  ```python
  i2c_manager = gpio_manager.I2CManager()
  ```
- To open the I2C bus:
  
  ```python
  i2c_manager.open(bus=1)
  ```

  - `bus`: The I2C bus number to open (default is 1).

- To close the I2C bus:
  
  ```python
  i2c_manager.close()
  ```
  
- To write a single byte to an I2C slave device:

  ```python
  i2c_manager.write_byte(0x20, 0xFF)
  ```
  
  - `0x20`: The I2C slave address.
  - `0xFF`: The byte to write.

- To write a single byte with a command to an I2C slave device:
  
  ```python
  i2c_manager.block_write_byte(0x20, 0x01, 0xFF)
  ```
  
  - `0x20`: The I2C slave address.

  ```
  - `0x20`: The I2C slave address.
