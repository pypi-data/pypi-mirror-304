# Package of Pathways-on-Cloud utilities

For customers to utilize Pathways-on-Cloud, there are several changes needed by
the user job. We encapsulate these changes in a single Python package for two
primary reasons. First, some of the changes are temporary patches that will not
be needed long-term. Second, several of the changes follow anti-patterns and
are now confined to a single repository.
