# TrustSource-pip-scan

TrustSource plugin for scanning python project installed pip dependencies and uploading them to [TrustSource](https://app.trustsource.io) for code compliance evaluation 
This package came about because official TrustSource provided packages ([ts-pip-plugin](https://github.com/TrustSource/ts-pip-plugin), [ts-python-client](https://github.com/TrustSource/ts-python-client)) and  either don't work as of this time or don't provide good integration in the CI/CD pipelines for python projects.
The library is influenced by [ts-pip-plugin](https://github.com/TrustSource/ts-pip-plugin)

This plugin is geared toward the use in CI/CD pipelines. It can do legal and vulnerability evaluation after TrustSource analysed the scan results. 
The package command exist with code 1 if evaluation fails.
