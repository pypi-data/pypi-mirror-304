# µfmt

Safe, atomic formatting with [black][] and [µsort][]

µfmt is a safe, atomic code formatter for Python built on top of [black][] and [µsort][]:

> Black makes code review faster by producing the smallest diffs possible. Blackened code looks the same regardless of the project you’re reading.

> μsort is a safe, minimal import sorter. Its primary goal is to make no “dangerous” changes to code, and to make no changes on code style.

µfmt formats files in-memory, first with µsort and then with black, before writing any
changes back to disk. This enables a combined, atomic step in CI/CD workflows for
checking or formatting files, without any chance of conflict or intermediate changes
between the import sorter and the code formatter.


Install
-------

µfmt requires Python 3.8 or newer. You can install it from PyPI:

```shell-session
$ pip install ufmt
```

If you want to prevent unexpected formatting changes that can break your CI workflow,
make sure to pin your transitive dependencies–including black, µsort, and µfmt–to your
preferred versions.

If you use `requirements.txt`, this might look like:

```text
black==22.6.0
ufmt==2.0.0
usort==1.0.4
```


Usage
-----

To format one or more files or directories in place:

```shell-session
$ ufmt format <path> [<path> ...]
```

To validate files are formatted correctly, like for CI workflows:

```shell-session
$ ufmt check <path> [<path> ...]
```

To validate formatting and generate a diff of necessary changes:

```shell-session
$ ufmt diff <path> [<path> ...]
```


Integrations
------------

See the [user guide](https://ufmt.omnilib.dev/en/latest/guide.html#integrations)
for details on each integration.

### GitHub Actions

µfmt provides a GitHub Action that can be added to an existing workflow,
or as a separate workflow or job, to enforce proper formatting in pull requests:

```yaml
jobs:
  ufmt:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: omnilib/ufmt@action-v1
        with:
          path: <PATH TO CHECK>
          requirements: requirements-fmt.txt
          python-version: "3.x"
```

### pre-commit hook

µfmt provides a [pre-commit][] hook. To format your diff before
every commit, add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/omnilib/ufmt
    rev: v2.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: ufmt
        additional_dependencies: 
          - black == 22.6.0
          - usort == 1.0.4
```

### Visual Studio Code

µfmt has an official VS Code extension to use µfmt as a formatter for Python files.
Once installed, µfmt can be set as the default formatter with the following settings:

```json
"[python]": {
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "omnilib.ufmt"
}
```

µfmt can automatically format when saving with the following settings:

```json
"[python]": {
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "omnilib.ufmt",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

For more details, or to install the extension, see the Visual Studio Marketplace page:
