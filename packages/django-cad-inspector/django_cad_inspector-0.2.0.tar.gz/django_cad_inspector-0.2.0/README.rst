django-cad-inspector
====================

Import CAD drawings into `Django <https://djangoproject.com>`__ and
inspect them in VR with
`A-Frame <https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/>`__

Requirements
------------

This project is tested on Django 5.1.2 and Python 3.12. It heavily
relies on outstanding `ezdxf <https://ezdxf.mozman.at/>`__ for handling
DXF files,
`django-colorfield <https://github.com/fabiocaccamo/django-colorfield>`__
for admin color fields.

Installation from PyPI
----------------------

Activate your virtual environment and install with:

::

   python -m pip install django-cad-inspector

In your Django project add:

.. code:: python

   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ...
       "colorfield",
       "cadinspector",
   ]

.. code:: python

   # my_project/urls.py
   urlpatterns = [
       # ...
       path('3d/', include('cadinspector.urls', namespace = 'cadinspector')),
   ]

Add two lists to ``my_project/settings.py``:

.. code:: python

   CAD_LAYER_BLACKLIST = [...]
   CAD_BLOCK_BLACKLIST = [...]

Here you can store names of layers and blocks you don't want to be
processed. Migrate and create a superuser.

Templates
~~~~~~~~~

You also need a ``base.html`` template with following template blocks (a
sample ``base.html`` is provided among package templates).

::

   {% block extra-head %}
   {% end block extra-head %}
   ...
   {% block content %}
   {% endblock content %}

Package comes with four templates, ``cadinspector/entity_list.html``,
``cadinspector/entity_detail.html``, ``cadinspector/scene_list.html``
and ``cadinspector/scene_detail.html``. Copy and override them in your
project templates if you want to add your styles.

Usage
-----

Run the server and navigate to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/3d``: you will be
presented with a ``Scene list``. Of course there still are no scenes, so
clik on the details and on the ``Add Scene`` link. Enter your
credentials to access the ``admin site``.

Scenes from a DXF
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter title, description and eventually an ``Equirectangular image`` to
simulate the environment, then upload a ``DXF`` file (it is a ``CAD``
exchange file). The ``DXF`` file must contain some ``meshes`` (if you
have ``3DSolids`` you have to convert them to ``Meshes``). Click on the
``Save and continue`` button. Thanks to the outstanding
`ezdxf <https://ezdxf.mozman.at/>`__ library, meshes are converted to
``*.obj files``, incorporated into ``Entity`` models and associated to
the ``Scene`` via ``Staging`` inlines. Each Staging holds information
for position, rotation, scale, color (extracted from the ``CAD Layer``
the mesh belonged to) and some data (more on that later). WARNING:
updating the ``DXF file`` will remove all entities staged on the Scene,
but not the entities. Also ``CAD Blocks`` with ``meshes`` will be
imported, each ``Block`` will be transformed into an ``Entity``, while
``Insertions`` will be transformed into ``Stagings`` and associated to
the ``Scene``. In the case of ``Blocks``, the appended data will contain
also ``Block attributes``. WARNING, some restrictions occour for
insertions when pitch rotation is 90 or -90 degrees. Visit the site at
``http://127.0.0.1:8000/3d`` again. Finally the ``Scene`` is listed.
Click on the link and access the ``A-Frame`` virtual reality: hold down
the right mouse button to look around, and use ``WASD`` keys to move.
When the cursor moves on an object, a popup with data should appear (if
data is associated to the staged entity).

Entities
~~~~~~~~

You can create ``Entities`` navigating to
``http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/cadinspector/entity/add/``: enter a Title
and Description, then upload an ``*.obj file``. If provided, the
associated ``*.mtl file`` and eventual images. Check the ``Switch``
field if your object was created in CAD: A-Frame coordinate system is
rotated with respect to CAD coordinate system. Alternatively you can
upload a ``*.gltf file``, which is the recommended format in A-Frame. If
uploaded, all other formats will be ignored.

Add Entities to Scenes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/cadinspector/scene/`` choose a Scene to
update. Add a ``Staged entity``, select one of the ``Entities`` you
created previously, adjust ``color``, ``position``, ``rotation`` and
``scale``. Stage as many entities you want (even multiple specimens of
the same entity), then update the Scene.

Entity utilities
----------------

Navigating to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/cadinspector/entity/`` shows
list of existing ``Entities``. Two admin actions are implemented to
manage them:

Check file names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uploading ``*.mtl file`` and images in Django may change their filename,
i.e. to avoid duplicate filenames. This can lead ``*.obj files`` and
``*.mtl files`` to miss their assets (filenames are hardcoded within
these files). Select corrupted ``Entities`` and run the routine:
hardcoded filenames will be rewritten to match actual uploaded
filenames.

Delete unstaged entities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As seen before, deleting a ``Staging`` does not delete the corresponding
``Entity``, which can be staged in multiple ``Scenes``. Select all
``Entities`` and run this routine if you want to get rid of unstaged
ones.

A-Frame Visual Inspector
------------------------

Once in the A-Frame window, if you press ``Ctrl + Alt + i`` you will
open the `A-Frame Visual
Inspector <https://aframe.io/docs/1.6.0/introduction/visual-inspector-and-dev-tools.html>`__.
It's possible to modify objects in the Inspector, save a ``*.gltf file``
from the whole scene, and then add it to an ``Entity``.

Next steps
----------

Create entities with lights, add shadows and some physics.

Tests
-----

Testing is done with unittest. At the moment coverage is 97%. Tested for
Django 4.2 against Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 versions and for Django
5.1 against Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 versions (3.13 on Windows).
