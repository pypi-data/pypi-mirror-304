# base_decryptor/__init__.py

# Import specific functions or classes from submodules, if desired
from .main import input_handler

# You can also expose any commonly used functions or modules here for easy import.
# For example, if you want to allow users to access `decode_single_input` or `file_decoder`
# directly from `base_decryptor`, you could import them here.

# from .utils.decode_single_input import decode_single_input
# from .utils.file_decoder import file_decoder

# Similarly, if there's anything useful in `decoders`, you can expose it here.
# from .decoders.base32_decoder import some_decoder_function  # If needed

# This file mainly serves as a convenience for organizing imports.
