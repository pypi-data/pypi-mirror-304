# gr8gen: protobuf generator for gr8pc

This tool is a direct adaptation of
[py-grpcio](https://github.com/Niche-Solutions-LLC/py-grpcio), featuring a few modifications and
tailored customizations. Depending on your needs, you may find the original repository better suited
to your requirements and preferred practices.

## Background and Motivation

As noted before, `gr8pc` is an adaptation of the `py-grpcio` library, with a few key modifications:

- **Python 3.11 Compatibility**: This library is compatible with Python 3.11 (the original library
  demands >=3.12).
- **Separation between Logic and Protobuf file Generation**: `gr8pc` splits into two subprojects:
  one for the core server and client logic, and another (optional) CLI tool for `.proto` file
  generation. This design decision was made to make the dependency on `jinja` not necessary for the
  core library. In other words, the core library won't generate `.proto` files during runtime and
  will raise an error if it can't find them. The `.proto` file must be generated at development time
  using the CLI tool.

## Installation

```bash
pip install gr8pc
```

To install the optional CLI:

```bash
pip install gr8gen
```

## Usage

For usage documentation, please refer to the original
[py-grpcio](https://github.com/Niche-Solutions-LLC/py-grpcio) repository.

## Proto Generation Tool

The gr8gen tool generates the necessary `.proto` file. Usage:

```bash
gr8gen --output /path/to/proto/folder --service path.to.service.Service path.to.another.service.AnotherService
```

## Acknowledgments

This library is derived directly from the `py-grpcio` package, maintaining much of the original
structure and functionality.
