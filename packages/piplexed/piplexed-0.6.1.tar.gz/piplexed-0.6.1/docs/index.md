## Overview

**Piplexed** is a command line tool to identify outdated python packages, installed from [**PyPI**](https://pypi.org/), via [**pipx**](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). It displays it's output as a [**rich**](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) printed table by default, with an alternative tree output available if desired.

### What is pipx ?

**Pipx** is a tool to help you install applications written in Python, into isolated environments with the ability to run them globally with no environment activation necessary.


## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- At least one python package installed with **pipx**

!!! note "Windows Users"

    If you experience issues with [strange characters being shown](https://github.com/aj-white/piplexed/issues/21), this is most likely due to Windows ability to handle utf-8 encoding.
    If this happens you may need to change the code page by typing `chcp 65001` or use a prompt like [ohmyposh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) which does this for you.
