    This research made use of Photutils, an Astropy package for
    detection and photometry of astronomical sources (Bradley et al.
    <YEAR>).

where (Bradley et al. <YEAR>) is a citation to the `Zenodo record
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596036>`_ of the Photutils version
that was used. We also encourage citations in the main text wherever
appropriate.
