## Some important rules
- If needed, install dependencies with
```bash
poetry add <lib>
```
- Use `ReStructuredText` docstrings.
- Respect typing annotation.
- Add documentation. Please take in consideration that if a new class was created, add it to `docs/source/modules.rst`.
Other functionality is better to be described in `docs/source/usage.rst`
- Black it:
```bash
black -l 120 <modified_file>
```
- Check how the docs look via `make html` from the `docs` folder and checking the `docs/build/html/index.html` page.
- Do not bump version.
- One may test the code by
```bash
# in project root
poetry build
pip3 uninstall robonomcis_interface -y  #if was installed previously
pip3 install pip3 install dist/robonomics_interface-<version>-py3-none-any.whl 
python3 <testing_script>
```
