# Asgineer
A really thin ASGI web framework üêçü§ò

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/asgineer/badge/?version=latest)](https://asgineer.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest)
[![Package Version](https://badge.fury.io/py/asgineer.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/asgineer)


## Introduction

[Asgineer](https://asgineer.readthedocs.io) is a tool to write asynchronous
web applications, using as few abstractions as possible, while still
offering a friendly API. The
[guide](https://asgineer.readthedocs.io/guide.html) and
[reference](https://asgineer.readthedocs.io/reference.html) take just a few
minutes to read!

When running Asgineer on [Uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn),
it is one of the fastest web frameworks available. It supports http
long polling, server side events (SSE), and websockets. And has utilities
to serve assets the right (and fast) way.

Asgineer is proudly used to serve e.g. https://pyzo.org and https://timetagger.app.


## Example

```py
# example.py

import asgineer

@asgineer.to_asgi
async def main(request):
    return f"<html>You requested <b>{request.path}</b></html>"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asgineer.run(main, 'uvicorn', 'localhost:8080')
```

You can start the server by running this script, or start it the *ASGI way*, e.g.
with Uvicorn:
```
$ uvicorn example:main --host=localhost --port=8080
```

## Installation and dependencies

Asgineer needs Python 3.8 or higher (may work on older versions but is not tested). To install or upgrade, run:
```
$ pip install -U asgineer
```

Asgineer has zero hard dependencies, but it
needs an ASGI server to run on, like
[Uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn),
[Hypercorn](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/hypercorn), or
[Daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne).


## Development

Install with `pip install -e .[dev]`.

Run `invoke -l` to get a list of dev commands, e.g.:

* `invoke autoformat` to apply Black code formatting.
* `invoke lint` to test for unused imports and more.
* `invoke tests` to run the tests, optionally set the `ASGI_SERVER` environment variable.
