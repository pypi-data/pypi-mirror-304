# Getting Started with ECUtils

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Are you ready to dive into Elliptic Curve Cryptography with ECUtils? Great! Let's make sure you've got everything set up properly.

## Before You Begin

Ensure that you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your machine. If not, head over to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and grab the latest version.

## Easy Installation Steps

To get ECUtils up and running, just open up your terminal or command prompt and punch in:

```bash
pip install ecutils
```

This nifty little command fetches ECUtils from PyPI and installs it along with any dependencies it needs. Easy, right?

## Prefer the Cutting-Edge Version?

If you're feeling adventurous and want the absolute latest and greatest, or if you're keen on contributing, you'll find the source over at our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/isakruas/ecutils.git). Here's what you do to clone and install it:

1. Whip open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Get your clone on:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/isakruas/ecutils.git
```

3. Navigate your way to the newly cloned directory:

```bash
cd ecutils
```

4. And install with pip's help:

```bash
pip install .
```

If you're setting up for development and want to make live changes, install using:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Checking the Install

Once you've installed ECUtils, give it a quick test by importing it in Python:

```python
import ecutils
```

No errors? Brilliant! You're all set.

## Time to Code!

Now that ECUtils is a part of your toolkit, you can start coding right away. Here's a peek at how to use it:

```python
from ecutils.algorithms import DigitalSignature

# The rest of your code goes here
```

Need more guidance? Check out our [documentation](https://ecutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Keep in mind to stay updated; run this every now and then:

```bash
pip install --upgrade ecutils
```
