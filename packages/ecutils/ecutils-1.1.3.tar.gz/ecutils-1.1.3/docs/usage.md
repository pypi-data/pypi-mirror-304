# Practical Guide

Discover how to harness the power of the `ecutils` library in the examples below. With `ecutils`, you can take your applications to the next level by using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for tasks like encoding messages, verifying signatures, and establishing secure communication channels. Let's get started!

### Encoding Messages with Koblitz

Convert plain text into secure elliptic curve points with the Koblitz method. Here's the process:

```python
# First, initialize the Koblitz with your chosen ECC curve.
from ecutils.algorithms import Koblitz

koblitz = Koblitz(curve_name='secp192k1')

# Now, let's encode a message into a point on the curve.
message = 'Hello, world!'
encoded_point, j = koblitz.encode(message)

# 'encoded_point' is now on the curve, and 'j' will aid in decoding later on.
```

### Generating Digital Signatures

Assure the authenticity and integrity of your messages with digital signatures. Here's how you can create one:

```python
# Start by getting your securely generated ECDSA private key.
from ecutils.algorithms import DigitalSignature

private_key = 123456789

# A good practice is to hash the message prior to signing.
message = 'Secure communication'
message_hash = hash(message)

# Instantiate a Digital Signature with your private key.
ds = DigitalSignature(private_key)

# Time to sign the message's hash.
r, s = ds.generate_signature(message_hash)

# Your signature, comprised of 'r' and 's', is prepared to confirm your message's authenticity.
```

### Participating in Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Diffie-Hellman protocol is essential for creating a shared secret over an insecure channel without exposing private keys. Here's how it works:

```python
# You'll need private keys for two participants.
from ecutils.protocols import DiffieHellman

alice_private = 12345
bob_private = 67890

# Set up instances for Alice and Bob.
alice_dh = DiffieHellman(alice_private)
bob_dh = DiffieHellman(bob_private)

# Alice computes a shared secret using Bob's public key.
alice_shared_secret = alice_dh.compute_shared_secret(bob_dh.public_key)

# Bob does the same with Alice's public key.
bob_shared_secret = bob_dh.compute_shared_secret(alice_dh.public_key)

# Ideally, Alice and Bob now have the same shared secret.
```

These examples should help you integrate ECC features into your projects. Whether you wish to safely encode data, create and verify signatures, or establish secure communication, `ecutils` is here to help.

Remember to peruse the `ecutils` documentation for specific details. With `ecutils` in your toolkit, you're equipped to enhance your applications' security. Happy coding!
