# Koblitz Encoding Guide

The `Koblitz` class provides an easy way to encode and decode text messages using the mathematical principles of elliptic curves. This technique is particularly useful for cryptographic purposes and involves mapping text to points on an elliptic curve and back.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Koblitz Class

To use the `Koblitz` class, you'll need to begin by creating an instance with a specific elliptic curve. You can select a curve, such as `secp192k1`, by specifying its name when initializing:

```python
from ecutils.algorithms import Koblitz

koblitz = Koblitz(curve_name='secp192k1')
```

### Encoding Messages

To encode a message, use the `encode` method. This converts a string message into a point on your chosen elliptic curve. When encoding, you'll receive a point and an integer `j`, both needed for decoding later:

```python
message = "Hello, world!"
point, j = koblitz.encode(message)
```

The variable `point` is a tuple containing the x and y coordinates, while `j` is an integer that helps reverse the encoding process.

### Decoding Messages

Decoding is just as simple. Use the `decode` method with the point and `j` integer from the encoding process. It will translate the point back into the original textual message:

```python
decoded_message = koblitz.decode(point, j)
```

You will find that `decoded_message` holds the same content as the message you encoded.

## Example from Start to Finish

Here's a full example showcasing how to encode a message and then decode it to verify that the original and decoded messages match:

```python
from ecutils.algorithms import Koblitz

# Initialize Koblitz with an elliptic curve.
koblitz = Koblitz(curve_name="secp521r1")

# Your message to be encoded.
original_message = "Koblitz encoding with elliptic curves!"

# Encoding the message into an elliptic curve point.
encoded_point, j = koblitz.encode(original_message)

# Getting your original message back from the encoded point.
decoded_message = koblitz.decode(encoded_point, j)

# Check if the decoded message is the same as the original.
assert decoded_message == original_message, "The decoded message should be the same as the original."
```

## Keep in Mind

- The choice of elliptic curve can influence both security and efficiency. Choose wisely based on your needs.
- Remember to track the `j` value obtained during encoding; without it, the decoding won't work.
- Since the `Koblitz` class uses elliptic curve mathematics, ensure that curve parameters and methods used are secure.

By following these steps and understanding the explanations provided, encoding and decoding messages with the `Koblitz` class and elliptic curves should be a breeze.
