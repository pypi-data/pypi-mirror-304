  :::{admonition} Local Override
  :class: tip dropdown
  
  When working with a local clone of the repository on your computer,
  you can override these configurations 
  by creating another `config.yaml` file with the same syntax
  in the root of the repository's local directory.
  Since the files under the local directory 
  are automatically added to the `.gitignore` file,
  this file will not be tracked by Git, 
  and thus will not be pushed to the remote repository.
  This allows you to easily maintain your own local configurations 
  without affecting the remote repository.
