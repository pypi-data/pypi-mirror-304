# Python Connector for Zoho CRM #

Python Connector for Zoho CRM is a connectivity solution for accessing Zoho
CRM from Python applications to read and update data. It fully implements
the Python DB API 2.0 specification. The connector is distributed as a wheel
package for Windows and Windows Server.

Standard SQL syntax

The connector fully supports the ANSI SQL standard and lets you execute SQL
statements against your Zoho CRM data just like you would normally work with
relational databases. Simple queries are directly converted to Zoho CRM API
calls and executed on the Zoho CRM side.
Complex queries are transformed into simpler queries, which are then converted
to Zoho CRM API calls. The embedded SQL engine then processes the results
in the local cache and applies advanced SQL features from the original complex
query.

## Using the connector ##

To retrieve data from a database:

Import the module.
```
import devart.zohocrm
```

Connect to a database using the `connect()` module method and obtain a `connection` object: 
If you have a refresh token:
```
my_connection = devart.zohocrm.connect(
    Domain="your_zoho_domain",
    RefreshToken="your_refresh_token"
)
```
If you don't have a refresh token:
```
response = devart.zohocrm.signin(Domain="your_zoho_domain")
my_connection = devart.zohocrm.connect(
    Domain="your_zoho_domain",
    RefreshToken=response["Refresh Token"]
)
```

Create a `cursor` object using the `cursor()` connection method.
```
my_cursor = my_connection.cursor()
```

Execute the SQL statement using the `execute()` cursor method.
```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
```

Retrieve the result set using one of the `fetch*()` cursor methods.
```
for row in my_cursor.fetchall(): 
    print(row)
```
