.. py:function:: beat_envelope(tempo, sample_rate, beat_sequence, envelope_type="hanning", envelope_duration=1000)
    
    Generates a beat envelope. You specify the tempo, and provide a list of beat durations in order.
    This function will generate a volume envelope that can be applied to a sound file to make it
    pulse with these beat durations.

    :param str envelope_type: The envelope used for fade-in and fade-out on each beat
    :param int envelope_duration: The envelope duration. The envelope will be split in half and applied to the beginning and end of the beat. If the beat is too short, a shorter envelope will be generated for that beat.
    :return: An array with the beat envelope
    :rtype: np.ndarray

    Exchanges samples in an audio file or STFT frames in a spectrum. Each sample (or STFT frame) 
    is swapped with the sample (or STFT frame) ``hop`` steps ahead or ``hop`` steps behind. If audio
    is being processed, it should be in the shape ``(channels, samples)``. If STFT data is being

.. py:function:: force_equal_energy(audio: np.ndarray, dbfs: float = -6.0, window_size: int = 8192)
    
    An algorithm that forces equal energy on a mono signal over time. 
    For example, if a signal initially has high energy, and gets less energetic, this will adjust 
    the energy level so that it does not decrease.
    Better results come with using a larger window size, so the energy changes more gradually.

    :param np.ndarray audio: The array of audio samples
    :param float dbfs: The target level of the entire signal, in dbfs
    :param int window_size: The window size to consider when detecting RMS energy

.. py:function:: leak_dc_bias_filter(audio: np.ndarray)

    of "Understanding Digital Signal Processing," 3rd edition, by Richard G. Lyons
    
    :param np.ndarray audio: The audio signal

    :return: The mixed audio
    :rtype: np.ndarray

.. py:function:: pan_level_adjuster(pan_levels: np.ndarray)

    Adjusts pan levels in a list for a power sum of 1. The values in the list should be fractional 
    volume levels that sum to 1. After applying this operations, the values in the list will be adjusted
    so that their squares now sum to 1. The levels are adjusted in place.

    The idea is that you might want to arbitrarily divide the total volume of a sound over several
    channels. However, you want the sum of the signal power to equal to 1. So you need to
    adjust these fractional levels so that the power sum is correct. This function computes
    a scalar that is applied to all of the pan levels to make the summed power level equal to 1.

    :param np.ndarray pan_levels: A list of pan levels (one level for each channel)

.. py:function:: pan_mapper(pan_coefficients: np.ndarray, mapper: np.ndarray)
    
    Maps pan positions to actual speaker positions. You pass a mapping array 
    that lists the speaker numbers in panning order.
    
    This is useful if you want to use a different numbering system for your 
    pan positions than the numbering system used for the actual output channels.
    For example, you might want to pan in a circle for a quad-channel setup,
    but the hardware is set up for stereo pairs.

    Example: Suppose you have a quad setup. Your mapper would be ``[0, 1, 3, 2]`` 
    if you are thinking clockwise, or ``[1, 0, 2, 3]`` if you are thinking counterclockwise. 
    If you have an 8-channel setup, your mapper would be ``[0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 2]`` 
    for clockwise and ``[1, 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 3]`` for counterclockwise.
    
    :param np.ndarray pan_coefficients: A list of pan coefficient lists
    :param np.ndarray mapper: The mapper for reordering the pan coefficients
    :return: A new, mapped pan coefficient list
    :rtype: np.ndarray

.. py:function:: panner(num_channels: int, start_pos: int, end_pos: int, num_iterations: int, pan_law: str = "constant_power")
    
    Multichannel panner, moving from ``start_pos`` to ``end_pos`` over ``num_iterations``.
    It generates a list of pan coefficients (each coefficient is the volume coefficient
    for the corresponding channel).
    (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/icm-online/readings/panlaws/panlaws.pdf)

    :param int num_channels: The number of channels
    :param float start_pos: The start panning position
    :param float end_pos: The end panning position
    :param int num_iterations: The number of steps to take to move from start_pos to end_pos
    :param str pan_law: The pan law ("linear", "constant_power", "neg_4_5_db")
    :return: An array of pan coefficients
    :rtype: np.ndarray

.. py:function:: stochastic_exchanger(data: np.ndarray, max_hop: int)

    Stochastically exchanges samples in an audio file or STFT frames in a spectrum. Each sample 
    (or STFT frame) is swapped with the sample (or STFT frame) up to ``max_hop`` steps ahead or ``max_hop`` 
    steps behind. If audio is being processed, it should be in the shape ``(channels, samples)``. 
    If STFT data is being processed, it should be in the shape ``(channels, frames, bins)``.
    
    .. WARNING::
        If you try to run this on sampled audio rather than STFT data, this will take a *very* long time!

    :param np.ndarray data: The audio (or spectrum) to process
    :param int hop: The hop size
    :return: The exchanged audio (or spectrum)
    :rtype: np.ndarray
