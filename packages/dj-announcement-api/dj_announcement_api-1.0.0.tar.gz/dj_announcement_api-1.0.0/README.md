# Quick Start

This section provides a fast and easy guide to getting the `dj-announcement-api` package up and running in your Django project. Follow the steps below to quickly set up the package and start using it.

### 1. Install the Package

**Option 1: Using `pip` (Recommended)**

Install the package via pip:

```bash
$ pip install dj-announcement-api
```
**Option 2: Using `Poetry`**

If you're using Poetry, add the package with:

```bash
$ poetry add dj-announcement-api
```

**Option 3: Using `pipenv`**

If you're using pipenv, install the package with:

```bash
$ pipenv install dj-announcement-api
```

The package requires ``djangorestframework`` for API support. If it's not already installed in your project, you can install it using one of the above methods:

**Using pip:**

```bash
$ pip install djangorestframework
```

### 2. Add to Installed Apps

After installing the necessary packages, ensure that both `rest_framework` and `django_announcement` are added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in your Django ``settings.py`` file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
   # ...
   "rest_framework",  # Required for API support

   "django_announcement",
   # ...
]
```

### 3. (Optional) Configure API Filters

To enable filtering of announcements through the API, install ``django-filter``, include ``django_filters`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and configure the filter settings.

Install ``django-filter`` using one of the above methods:

**Using pip:**

```bash
$ pip install django-filter
```

Add `django_filters` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
   # ...
   "django_filters",
   # ...
]
```

Then, set the filter class configuration in your ``settings.py``:

```python
DJANGO_announcement_API_FILTERSET_CLASS = (
   "django_announcement.api.filters.announcement_filter.AnnouncementFilter"
)
```

You can also define your custom `FilterClass` and reference it in here if needed. This allows you to customize the filtering behavior according to your requirements.


### 4. Apply Migrations

Run the following command to apply the necessary migrations:

```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Add Announcement API URLs

Include the announcement API routes in your projectâ€™s `urls.py` file:

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
   # ...
   path("announcement/", include("django_announcement.api.routers")),
   # ...
]
```

### 6. Generate Audiences and Profiles

After setting up the package and applying the migrations, run the management commands to generate the necessary audiences based on user related models and generate announcement profiles for users to assign audience to them.

First, generate the audiences using the ``generate_audiences`` command:

```shell

$ python manage.py generate_audiences
```

Then, assign users to these audiences by running the ``generate_profiles`` command:

```shell
$ python manage.py generate_profiles
```

### 7. Create Announcements via Django Admin

Now, you can create announcements using the Django admin interface.

- Log in to the Django admin site.
- Navigate to the **Announcements** section.
- Click **Add Announcement** to create a new announcement, filling out the required fields such as title, content and category.
- Optionally, select the target audiences and attach files if needed.

Once saved, your announcements will be available to the users assigned to the relevant audiences.


### 8. Verify Announcements

Once announcements are created, they can be viewed through the API endpoints. To test and verify the creation, make a request to the relevant endpoint, for example:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/announcement/annoucements/
```

This will return a list of announcements created in the admin.

---

With the setup complete, the ``dj-announcement-api`` is ready for use in your project. For further customizations and settings, refer to the [API Guide](#api-guide) and [Settings](#settings) sections.

----

# API Guide

This section provides a detailed overview of the Django Announcement API, allowing users to manage announcements efficiently. The API exposes two main endpoints:


## Announcements API

The ``announcement/announcements/`` endpoint provides the following features:

- **List active announcements**:

  Fetches all active announcements for the authenticated user (all announcements for admin users). Controlled by the ``DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_API_ALLOW_LIST`` setting.

- **Retrieve an announcement**:

  Retrieves a specific active announcement by its ID. Controlled by the ``DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_API_ALLOW_RETRIEVE`` setting.

---

## Example Responses

Here are some examples of responses for each action:


**List announcements with full details**:

```text
GET /announcement/announcements/

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

"results": [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "test announcement",
        "content": "some content",
        "category": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "test category",
            "description": "something!"
        },
        "audience": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "name": "new audience",
                "description": null
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "name": "another audience",
                "description": null
            },
        ],
        "published_at": "2024-10-18T08:49:52Z",
        "expires_at": null,
        "attachment": null,
        "created_at": "2024-10-18T08:49:09Z",
        "updated_at": "2024-10-18T09:10:41.743564Z"
    }
]
```

If the ``DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_SERIALIZER_INCLUDE_FULL_DETAILS`` setting is ``True``, this detailed response will be returned for all users.

**List announcements with simplified data**:

```text
GET /announcement/announcements/

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

"results": [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "first announcement",
        "content": "some content",
        "category": {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "test category",
            "description": "something!"
        },
        "published_at": "2024-10-18T08:49:52Z",
        "expires_at": null,
        "attachment": null,
        "created_at": "2024-10-18T08:49:09Z",
        "updated_at": "2024-10-18T09:10:41.743564Z"
    },

  ...
]
```

This response is returned when ``DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_SERIALIZER_INCLUDE_FULL_DETAILS`` is set to ``False``. Admins always see full details.


> **Note:**
>
> you can exclude Any fields with empty value in the response output by adding this config in your ``settings.py``:

```python
DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_SERIALIZER_EXCLUDE_EMPTY_FIELDS = True
```

---

## Throttling

The API includes a built-in throttling mechanism that limits the number of requests a user can make based on their role. You can customize these throttle limits in the settings file.

To specify the throttle rates for authenticated users and staff members, add the following in your settings:

```ini
DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_AUTHENTICATED_USER_THROTTLE_RATE = "100/day"
DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_STAFF_USER_THROTTLE_RATE = "60/minute"
```

These settings limit the number of requests users can make within a given timeframe.

**Note:** You can define custom throttle classes and reference them in your settings.

---

## Filtering, Ordering, and Search

The API supports filtering, ordering, and searching of announcements. Filter Class can be applied optionally, allowing users to narrow down results.

Options include:

- **Filtering**: By default filtering feature is not included, If you want to use this, you need to add ``django_filters`` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and provide the path to the ``AnnouncementFilter`` class (``"django_announcement.api.filters.announcement_filter.AnnouncementFilter"``). Alternatively, you can use a custom filter class if needed.

  - **Note**: for more clarification, refer to the `DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_API_FILTERSET_CLASS` in :doc:`Settings <settings>` section.

- **Ordering**: Results can be ordered by fields such as ``id``, ``timestamp``, or ``public``.

- **Search**: You can search fields like ``verb`` and ``description``.

These fields can be customized by adjusting the related configurations in your Django settings.

---

## Pagination

The API supports limit-offset pagination, with configurable minimum, maximum, and default page size limits. This controls the number of results returned per page.

---

## Permissions

The base permission for all endpoints is ``IsAuthenticated``, meaning users must be logged in to access the API. You can extend this by creating custom permission classes to implement more specific access control.

For instance, you can allow only specific user roles to perform certain actions.

---

## Parser Classes

The API supports multiple parser classes that control how data is processed. The default parsers include:

- ``JSONParser``
- ``MultiPartParser``
- ``FormParser``

You can modify parser classes by updating the API settings to include additional parsers or customize the existing ones to suit your project.

----

Each feature can be configured through the Django settings file. For further details, refer to the [Settings](#settings) section.

# Usage

This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to utilize the package's key features, including the functionality of the Django admin panels for managing announcements, announcement categories, audiences, user announcement profile and Manager methods for handling announcements.

## Admin Site

If you are using a **custom admin site** in your project, you must pass your custom admin site configuration in your Django settings. Otherwise, Django may raise the following error during checks:

```shell
ERRORS:
<class 'django_announcement.admin.announcement_profile.UserAnnouncementProfileAdmin'>:
(admin.E039) An admin for model "User" has to be registered to be referenced by UserAnnouncementProfileAdmin.autocomplete_fields.
```

To resolve this, In your ``settings.py``, add the following setting to specify the path to your custom admin site class instance

```python
DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_ADMIN_SITE_CLASS = "path.to.your.custom.site"
```

example of a custom Admin Site:

```python
from django.contrib.admin import AdminSite

class CustomAdminSite(AdminSite):
  site_header = "Custom Admin"
  site_title = "Custom Admin Portal"
  index_title = "Welcome to the Custom Admin Portal"


# Instantiate the custom admin site as example
example_admin_site = CustomAdminSite(name="custom_admin")
```

and then reference the instance like this:

```python
DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_ADMIN_SITE_CLASS = "path.to.example_admin_site"
```

This setup allows `dj-announcement-api` to use your custom admin site for its Admin interface, preventing any errors and ensuring a smooth integration with the custom admin interface.

```

## generate_audiences Command

The ``generate_audiences`` command dynamically creates audiences based on models related to the ``User``. It allows filtering out specific apps and models through configuration settings, and includes an optional user confirmation step before proceeding.

### Command Overview

This command scans for related models in the ``User`` (excluding those defined in the settings), confirms the list of models with the user, and creates audiences if they don't already exist. It is useful for dynamically creating target audiences for announcements based on your application's data models.

### Settings

This command is influenced by two key settings:

- ``DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_GENERATE_AUDIENCES_EXCLUDE_APPS``:
  A list of app labels to exclude from the audience generation process.

- ``DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_GENERATE_AUDIENCES_EXCLUDE_MODELS``:
  A list of model names to exclude from the audience generation process.

These settings allow for fine-grained control over which models are considered for audience creation.

### Usage

The command can be run using Django's ``manage.py`` utility:

```bash
$ python manage.py generate_audiences
```

### Optional Arguments

- ``--skip-confirmation``:
  Skips the user confirmation prompt and proceeds directly to creating audiences.

Example usage:

```bash
$ python manage.py generate_audiences --skip-confirmation
```

### Command Flow

1. **Retrieve Related Models**:
   The command first retrieves all models related to the ``User`` by checking the relationships. It filters out any models and apps specified in the ``DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_GENERATE_AUDIENCES_EXCLUDE_APPS`` and ``DJANGO_ANNOUNCEMENT_GENERATE_AUDIENCES_EXCLUDE_MODELS`` settings.

2. **Prompt for Confirmation**:
   The command lists the related models found and asks for confirmation from the user to proceed. If the ``--skip-confirmation`` flag is provided, this step is bypassed.

3. **Create Audiences**:
   For each related model that doesn't already have a corresponding audience, the command creates a new audience and saves it in the database. It checks the existing audiences by their name to avoid duplications.

### Example Output

When running the command, the following example output might be displayed:

```text
The following related models were found:
1. User Profile
2. Organization

Are these the correct target models? Type 'y' to proceed or 'n' to modify settings: y
Created audience: User Profile
Created audience: Organization
Finished creating audiences!
```

If no new audiences are needed, you would see:

```text
No new audiences needed to be created.
```

---

## generate_profiles Command

The ``generate_profiles`` command assigns users to dynamically created audiences using the ``UserAnnouncementProfile`` model. It ensures that users are correctly associated with audiences based on user-related models in the database. This command should be run after the ``generate_audiences`` command to link users to the relevant audiences.

### Command Overview

This command checks if the audience generation has been completed, then proceeds to create user profiles if they do not already exist. It builds and assigns audience-user relationships dynamically, based on the user-related models detected in the system.

### Usage

The command can be run using Django's ``manage.py`` utility:

```bash
$ python manage.py generate_profiles
```

### Optional Arguments

- ``--skip-confirmation``:
  Skips the user confirmation prompt and proceeds directly to assigning users to audiences.

Example usage:

```bash
$ python manage.py generate_profiles --skip-confirmation
```

### Command Flow

1. **Check Audience Generation**:
   The command prompts the user to confirm whether the ``generate_audiences`` command has been run. If this confirmation is not provided (or skipped using the ``--skip-confirmation`` flag), the command exits.

2. **Retrieve Related Users**:
   The command fetches users related to models detected in the ``User`` by foreign key or related relationships.

3. **Create User Profiles**:
   If a user does not already have an associated ``UserAnnouncementProfile``, the command creates one.

4. **Assign Audiences**:
   Audiences are mapped to users based on the related models, and new assignments are created if they do not already exist. This avoids duplicate assignments.

### Settings Impact

This command depends on the previous execution of the ``generate_audiences`` command, which creates the necessary audiences. Make sure that step has been completed before running this command.

### Example Output

When running the command, the following example output might be displayed:

```text
Ensure you've run the 'generate_audiences' command before proceeding.
Have you already run 'generate_audiences'? (yes/no): yes
All users have been assigned to existing audiences successfully.
```

If no related users are found or if audiences are missing, you would see:

```text
No users found related to the provided models.
No valid audiences found. Please run 'generate_audiences' first. Exiting...
```

# Examples

This section provides examples on how to handle various conditions in your project using ``dj-announcement-api``.

## Assigning New Users to Audiences

To automatically assign new registered users to specific audiences, `dj-announcement-api` provides several methods. You can use the management commands (``generate_audiences`` and ``generate_profiles``) to assign related users to their appropriate audiences. However, for real-time assignment of new users, automating this within models, serializers, or signals may be more efficient. Below are three recommended approaches for automatic assignment, along with instructions on command usage.

### Method 1: Using the Model's `save` Method


In this approach, user-audience assignments are handled within the model's `save` method of the related model. This method can check if an instance is newly created and, if so, ensures that an `AnnouncementProfile` is generated automatically.

Steps:
1. Check for the audience corresponding to the model's verbose name, creating it if necessary.
2. Create an `AnnouncementProfile` for the new user associated with the audience.

```python
from django.db import models
from django_announcement.models import Audience, UserAnnouncementProfile

class RelatedUserModel(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField("User", on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    # additional fields

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        is_new = self.pk is None
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)

        if is_new:
            # Retrieve or create the audience based on model name
            audience, _ = Audience.objects.get_or_create(
                name=self._meta.verbose_name.title()
            )

            # Create the announcement profile for this user
            profile, _ = UserAnnouncementProfile.objects.get_or_create(
                user=self.user
            )
            profile.audiences.add(audience)
            profile.save()
```

Using this method ensures that each time a user instance is created, audience assignment occurs immediately.

### Method 2: In the Serializer's `create` Method

For a more API-focused approach, handle audience assignments directly in the serializer's `create` method. This is ideal when user creation is managed through API endpoints.

```python

from rest_framework import serializers
from django_announcement.models import Audience, UserAnnouncementProfile

class RelatedUserModelSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = RelatedUserModel
        fields = '__all__'

    def create(self, validated_data):
        instance = super().create(validated_data)

        # Fetch or create the audience
        audience, _ = Audience.objects.get_or_create(
            name=instance._meta.verbose_name.title()
        )

        # Assign the user to the audience
        profile, _ = UserAnnouncementProfile.objects.get_or_create(
            user=instance.user
        )
        profile.audiences.add(audience)
        profile.save()

        return instance
```

This approach is best for API-based workflows where user creation is handled via serializers.

### Method 3: Using Signals

Signals allow handling audience assignments whenever a new user instance is created, keeping assignment logic separate from models and serializers.

Steps:
1. Create a post-save signal for the user-related model.
2. In the signal, retrieve or create the appropriate audience and announcement profile.

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django_announcement.models import Audience, UserAnnouncementProfile
from .models import RelatedUserModel

@receiver(post_save, sender=RelatedUserModel)
def assign_audience_to_new_user(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        # Retrieve or create audience
        audience, _ = Audience.objects.get_or_create(
            name=instance._meta.verbose_name.title()
        )

        # Assign user to the audience
        profile, _ = UserAnnouncementProfile.objects.get_or_create(
            user=instance.user
        )
        profile.audiences.add(audience)
        profile.save()
```

This approach enhances maintainability, particularly when user creation might occur in multiple parts of the codebase.

## Using Management Commands for Batch Assignment

If new roles or related models are added and require new audience creation, you can use the management commands:

1. Run ``generate_audiences`` to create audiences based on related models if they don't already exist.
2. Run ``generate_profiles`` to assign users to these audiences in bulk.

These commands are useful for batch operations and can be combined with the methods above to automatically assign audiences to new users as they are created.

## Conclusion

For automating audience assignments to new users, choose the approach that best suits your workflow:

- **Model save method** for tightly coupled functionality.
- **Serializer `create` method** for API-driven workflows.
- **Signals** for separation of concerns and modularity.
- **Management commands** for batch assignment and new role or audience generation.

```

This setting allows fine-tuned control over which models are excluded from audience creation, even if their app is not fully excluded.

---

### All Available Fields

These are all fields that are available for searching, ordering, and filtering in the announcements API with their recommended usage:

- ``id``: Unique identifier of the announcement (orderable, filterable).
- ``title``: The title or subject of the announcement (searchable).
- ``category``: The category of the announcement (filterable).
- ``content``: The body or description of the announcement (searchable).
- ``audience``: The audience receiving the announcement (filterable).
