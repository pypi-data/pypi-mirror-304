## Installation

### System requirements
+ Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12.
+ Optional: Hardware accelerator supporting [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
> Recommended: NVIDIA graphics card with 12GB memory or larger.

### Install `biodem`
> [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) / [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) is recommended for installation.

1. Create a conda environment:
    ```sh
    mamba create -n dem python=3.11
    mamba activate dem

    # Install PyTorch with CUDA support
    mamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.4 -c pytorch -c nvidia
    ```

2. Install biodem package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/biodem)
    ```sh
    pip install biodem
    ```

## Usage

Please checkout the documentations at [cma2015.github.io/DEM](https://cma2015.github.io/DEM).

<br></br>

## [`biodem`](https://pypi.org/project/biodem) comprises 4 functional modules:

### 1. Data preprocessing

> **Nested cross-validation** is recommended for data preprocessing.

+ _Steps:_
    1. Split data into nested cross-validation sets.
    2. Imputation & standardization.
    2. Feature selection using the variance threshold filter and Random Forests.
    3. SNP2Gene transformation.

### 2. Dual-extraction modeling

+ It takes preprocessed multi-omics data and phenotypic data as inputs. DEM is capable of performing both classification and regression tasks.

### 3. Phenotypic prediction

+ It loads the trained DEM model checkpoint and performs phenotypic prediction.

### 4. Functional gene mining

+ It performs functional gene mining based on the trained DEM model through _feature ranking by permutation_.
