# Introduction

[**libinsitu**](http://libinsitu.org) is a library to transform in situ data time series) into a standard *NetCDF* format.

It was primilary developed for solar in situ data, but is also adapted to other usages. 

The aim is to improve **standardization** and **interoperability**, to leverage development of new tools.  

It provides :
* A set of [CLI utilities](cli/index) and [Python functions](api/index) to :
  * Transform **raw input files** into **NetCDF** format
  * **Explore & query** NetCDF files, and transform it to various formats (*CSV*, *JSON*, *text*, *pandas Dataframes*)
  * Flag data with **quality checks** and produce graphs for **visual quality control**
* A set of {gitref}`formatted and enriched metadata<libinsitu/res/station-info>` for several networks and their stations.
* A [proposed convention](conventions.md) for in-situ data, on top of CF conventions.

In addition, we process input data for many networks of solar data and [make them available](data) 
through a [Thredds data server](http://tds.webservice-energy.org/thredds/catalog.html) and 
a [web interface](http://viewer.webservice-energy.org/in-situ/). For more details, see the [data](data) section.
