------------------------------------------

Textual-PyFiglet is an implementation of [PyFiglet](https://github.com/pwaller/pyfiglet) for [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).

It provides a `FigletWidget` which is designed to be easy to use inside of Textual.

# Key features


### Textual-PyFiglet is a fork of PyFiglet:

The original PyFiglet has zero dependencies, since it's a full re-write of FIGlet in Python. Thus by forking, Textual-PyFiglet also has zero dependencies (aside from Textual of course). PyFiglet is bundled inside as a sub-package.

I made sure to preserve the full git history of PyFiglet, as well as its original CLI and demo (see Demo Program below).

### Minimized:

PyFiglet wheel: **1.1 MB**.  -->   Textual-PyFiglet wheel: **71 KB**.

99% of the size of PyFiglet is just the massive fonts collection, 519 in total. In the base textual-pyfiglet package I've included only 10 of the best minimal fonts. I've also made it very easy to download the full collection for those who still want it (use extended fonts install, shown at the top)

### Widget easily drops into your Textual app:

The widget is based on `Static` and is designed to mimick its behavior. That means it can drop-in replace any Static widget, and it should just work without even adding or changing arguments (using default font). Assuming you're accounting for the size of the text somehow.

It achieves this by simply overriding the `update()` method in Static. When update is called, PyFiglet will convert the input text, and PyFiglet's output is passed to `self.renderable`.

By default, the FigletWidget will automatically set its own size when it updates. (width and height are set to auto). But, **it will also respect any container or widget it's inside of, and wrap the text accordingly.**

### Real-time updating:

This real-time updating can be seen in the included demo, as well as the OG online generator:   
https://patorjk.com/software/taag/

It's easy to implement in your own Textual app. See below.

### Extended fonts collection moved to separate package:

If you want the whole collection, simply use:   
`pip install textual-pyfiglet[fonts]`

You can install the whole thing straight from that command, or use it to add the fonts to an existing install. The fonts package is about 1.5 MB (compressed). 

The included 10 fonts I hand-picked were chosen for being small, minimalist, and professional looking. For people that don't want to think about fonts, these 10 will probably be all you need.

You can also easily add more fonts by just downloading individual font files the oldschool way, and plopping them in the fonts folder (inside the Pyfiglet folder, which will be in /lib/python/site-packages/textual-pyfiglet)

A good website to download individual fonts:

# Usage

### Demo program, CLI:
Run the demo program with either:   
`textual-pyfiglet`   
Or:   
`python -m textual_pyfiglet`

PyFiglet also has its own CLI which has been kept available. (Which has its own built-in demo program.) You can access the PyFiglet CLI with:   
`python -m textual_pyfiglet.pyfiglet`

Try it out to see the options. For instance, try running this code:   
`python -m textual_pyfiglet.pyfiglet Hey guys, whats up?`   

# How to use:

FigletWidget is designed to be used like a normal Static widget.

You can simply create one with the  Textual syntax:

```python
from textual_pyfiglet import FigletWidget

def compose(self):
   yield FigletWidget("Label of Things", id="figlet1")
```

In this case it will use the default font, Calvin_s. You can also specify a font in the constructor:

```python
yield FigletWidget("Label of Things", id="figlet1" font="small")
```

## Resizing

The FigletWidget will try to wrap to whatever parent container it is inside of. If you want to contain it to an area, it's best to place it inside a container:

```python
with Container(id="figlet_container1", classes="figlet_labels"):
   yield FigletWidget("Label of Things", id="figlet1")
```

You can resize the container, and then trigger the FigletWidget update method:

```python
def resize_container(self, width: int):
   self.query("#figlet_container1").styles.width = width
   self.query("#figlet1").update(resized=True)
```
Note that whenever you are updating to resize the widget's render area, you must use the `resized=True` argument.

Likewise you can set it to resize when the screen size changes by calling it from the main app. This is assuming it's inside a container which would be affected by this.

```python
class MyTextualApp(App):

   def on_resize(self):
      self.query("#figlet1").update(resized=True)
```
## Change the font:

The widget will update automatically when this is run:
```python
self.query("#figlet1").set_font(new_font)
```
| Base fonts  |                |
|-------------|----------------|
| calvin_s    | smblock
| chunky      | smbraille 
| cybermedium | standard
| small_slant | stick_letters
| small       | tmplr

If the extended fonts pack is not installed, the widget will do a quick check every launch to see if its been downloaded. So you can install it afterwards any time you feel like it.

## Live updating / Passing text

To update the FigletWidget with new text, simply pass it in the update method:

```python
self.query_one("#figlet1").update(text)
```

For instance, if you have a TextArea widget where a user can enter text, you can do this:

```python
@on(TextArea.Changed)
def text_changed(self):
   text = self.query_one("#text_input").text
   self.query_one("#figlet1").update(text)
```
The FigletWidget will then auto-update with every key-stroke.   
Note that you cannot pass in a Rich renderable, like the normal Static widget - the text has to be a normal string for PyFiglet to work.

You can access two lists of installed fonts through methods in the FigletWidget:

```python
figlet1 = self.query_one("#figlet1")
all_fonts = figlet1.get_fonts_list(get_all=True)
base_fonts = figlet1.get_fonts_list(get_all=False)  # only get standard 10
```

FIGlet fonts have existed for a long time. There's a bunch of good generators on the internet. Just google "figlet online".
Several of those were very helpful for me so big thanks to anyone that has made a FIGlet generator of some kind.

And finally, thanks to the many hundreds of people that contributed to the fonts collection.
