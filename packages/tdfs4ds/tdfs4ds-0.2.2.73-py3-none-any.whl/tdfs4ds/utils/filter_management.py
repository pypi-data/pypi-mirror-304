class FilterManager:
    """
    Manages dynamic filtering on a database table by creating and managing a view based on filter criteria.

    This class is designed to facilitate the management of filtered views on a database table, allowing for dynamic selection of data based on filter criteria. It handles the creation and update of a filtered view based on a specified filter ID, supporting operations like loading new filters, updating existing filters, and dropping the filter view if necessary.

    Attributes:
        schema_name (str): Name of the schema in the database where the table and view are located.
        table_name (str): Name of the underlying table in the schema that holds the data to be filtered.
        view_name (str): Name of the view to be created or managed, which will present filtered data.
        filter_id_name (str): The column name used to identify different filters. Defaults to 'filter_id'.
        nb_filters (int): The number of filters currently defined in the table. This is updated when filters are loaded or modified.
    """

        """
        Initializes the FilterManager with names for the table, schema, and an optional name for the filter ID column.

        Upon initialization, it checks if the specified table exists; if so, it sets up the necessary attributes including the current number of filters. If the table does not exist, the initialization process includes provisions for table creation.

        Args:
            table_name (str): Name of the table to manage filters for.
            schema_name (str): Name of the schema where the table is located.
