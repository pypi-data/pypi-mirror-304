# Converting images to data

Marvin can use OpenAI's vision API to process images and convert them into structured data, transforming unstructured information into native types that are appropriate for a variety of programmatic use cases.


<div class="admonition abstract">
  <p class="admonition-title">What it does</p>
  <p>
    The <code>cast</code> function can cast images to structured types.

<div class="admonition info">
  <p class="admonition-title">How it works</p>
  <p>
    
  This involves a two-step process: first, a caption is generated for the image that is aligned with the structuring goal. Next, the actual cast operation is performed with an LLM.

!!! example "Example: locations"

    We will cast this image to a `Location` type:

    ```python
    import marvin
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


    class Location(BaseModel):
        city: str
        state: str = Field(description="2-letter state abbreviation")


    img = marvin.Image(
        "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1568515387631-8b650bbcdb90",
    )
    result = marvin.cast(img, target=Location)
    ```

    !!! success "Result"
        ```python
        assert result == Location(city="New York", state="NY")
        ```

!!! example "Example: getting information about a book"

    We will cast this image to a `Book` to extract key information:

    ![](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/CoverII_small.jpg){ width="250" }


    ```python
    import marvin
    from pydantic import BaseModel


    class Book(BaseModel):
        title: str
        subtitle: str
        authors: list[str]


    img = marvin.Image(
        "https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/CoverII_small.jpg",
    )
    result = marvin.cast(img, target=Book)
    ```

    !!! success "Result"
        ```python
        assert result == Book(
            title='The Elements of Statistical Learning',
            subtitle='Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction',
            authors=['Trevor Hastie', 'Robert Tibshirani', 'Jerome Friedman']
        )
        ```

## Instructions

If the target type isn't self-documenting, or you want to provide additional guidance, you can provide natural language `instructions` when calling `cast` in order to steer the output. 


!!! example "Example: checking groceries"

    Let's use this image to see if we got everything on our shopping list:

    ![](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588964895597-cfccd6e2dbf9)

    ```python
    import marvin

    shopping_list = ["bagels", "cabbage", "eggs", "apples", "oranges"]
    
    missing_items = marvin.cast(
        marvin.Image("https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588964895597-cfccd6e2dbf9"), 
        target=list[str], 
        instructions=f"Did I forget anything on my list: {shopping_list}?",
    )

    ```

    !!! success "Result"
        ```python
        assert missing_items == ["eggs", "oranges"]
        ```
## Model parameters
You can pass parameters to the underlying API via the `model_kwargs` argument of `cast`. These parameters are passed directly to the API, so you can use any supported parameter.

## Async support
If you are using `marvin` in an async environment, you can use `cast_async`:

```python
result = await marvin.cast_async("one", int) 

assert result == 1
```

## Mapping

To transform a list of inputs at once, use `.map`:

```python
inputs = [
    "I bought two donuts.",
    "I bought six hot dogs."
]
result = marvin.cast.map(inputs, int)
assert result  == [2, 6]
```

(`marvin.cast_async.map` is also available for async environments.)

Mapping automatically issues parallel requests to the API, making it a highly efficient way to work with multiple inputs at once. The result is a list of outputs in the same order as the inputs.
