LSDelta - Least Significant Digit Delta
=======================================

`lsdelta` is a simple little library that provides a single function:

**`lsdelta(a :str|bytes, b :str|bytes) -> int`**

This function takes two decimal numbers stored as strings,
pads them both to the same length after the decimal point,
and then removes the decimal point and subtracts them,
giving you the difference in their least significant digits.

    >>> from lsdelta import lsdelta
    >>> lsdelta("399.999","400")
    -1
    >>> lsdelta("1035.349", "1035.35")
    -1
    >>> lsdelta("1035.110", "1035.1")
    10
