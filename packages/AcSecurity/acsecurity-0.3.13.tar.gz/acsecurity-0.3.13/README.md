2. Run the scanner using the command below, replacing `/path/to/your/application` with the path to your application directory:

   ```bash
   acsecurity /path/to/your/application
   ```

3. The scanner will output any vulnerabilities found in your application.

### Example

```bash
acsecurity /home/user/my_project
```

## Version View and Help View

```bash
acsecurity --version
acsecurity --help
```

## Features

- **Common Vulnerability Checks**: Scans for hardcoded secrets such as passwords or API keys in your code.
- **Dependency Vulnerability Checks**: Uses `pip-audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in your installed Python packages.
- **Code Quality Checks**: Uses `pylint` to identify code quality issues and ensure your code adheres to best practices.
- **Output**: All findings are written to `issues.txt` in the current directory.
- **Version:** you can know use ```--version``` and view the version you have
- **Help** you can know use ```--help``` and get Help and see what you can do.
