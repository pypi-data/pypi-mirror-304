Introduction
======================================

As the universe cooled after the Hot Big Bang, it may have gone through any number of cosmological first-order phase transitions. Such transitions proceed via the nucleation and growth of bubbles, as shown in the image below. :footcite:p:`Weir_2016` The collisions of these bubbles may lead to an observable gravitational wave signal today, depending on the speed of the bubble walls as they collide.

How fast does the bubble wall go? WallGo is a Python package for answering this question. Our methods largely follow previous work by Laurent and Cline. :footcite:p:`Laurent:2022jrs`
