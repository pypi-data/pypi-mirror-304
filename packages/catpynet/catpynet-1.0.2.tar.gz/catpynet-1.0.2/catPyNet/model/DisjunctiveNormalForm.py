def compute(expression: str) -> str:
    """
    Return a Disjunctive Normal Form of the expression as a str.

    The resulting str uses "," as "or"/disjunction and "&" as 
    "and"/conjunction and does not contain any brackets.
    The input-expression can contain the logical operators:
        "or" as ","
        "and" as "&"
        brackets as "(" and ")" 
    Everything else will be treated as elements.
    There cannot be any whitespaces in the input-expression.

    Parameters:
        expression  (str): A logical expression with brackets to be turned
        into a DNF without brackets
