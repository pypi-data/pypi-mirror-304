# DEVSIM

## Introduction:
**DEVSIM** - TCAD Device Simulator

**DEVSIM** is a tool for TCAD Device Simulation, using finite volume methods.  The source code is provided by DEVSIMÂ LLC.

## Website:

The official website is here:

[https://devsim.org](https://devsim.org)

## Software Features:

* Python scripting 
* DC, small-signal AC, impedance field method, transient
* User specified partial differential equations (PDE).
* Extended floating point precision
* 1D, 2D, and 3D simulation
* 1D, 2D mesher
* Import 3D meshes.
* 2D cylindrical coordinate simulation
* ASCII file format with PDE embedded.
