              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# dockstring

![Code Style: yapf](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-yapf-orange.svg)

A Python package for easy molecular docking and docking benchmarking.
We can dock molecules in a few lines of code from just a SMILES string!
For details, see [our paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01334)
and our [website](https://dockstring.github.io/):

> García-Ortegón, Miguel, et al. "DOCKSTRING: easy molecular docking yields better benchmarks for ligand design." Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling (2021).

## Installation

**Supported platforms:**
This package is primarily intended for Linux, but we have some support for Mac.
Please note that the scores from the Mac version do not always perfectly match the Linux version,
so we encourage the use of the Linux version whenever possible.

**Package versions:**

When installing dockstring, please be mindful of which package versions you install.
The dockstring dataset was created using:

- `rdkit=2021.03.3`
- `openbabel=3.1.1`
- `python=3.7.10`

If you want to reproduce the calculations of the dockstring dataset exactly
(or calculate docking scores completely consistent with the dataset)
then ideally install these versions of the packages above.
However, python 3.7 has reached end of life, so we have tested higher versions of the packages:
It appears that `python<=3.10, openbabel=3.1.1, rdkit<=2022.03` will also work.
Ultimately we just suggest being mindful of which version you install,
and test whether it matches the dataset values after installation (instructions on this below).
If in doubt, use our `environment.yml` file.
Note that if you do not care about consistency with our pre-computed dataset then any package version is ok.

**Installation instructions:**

We recommend installing with `conda` using our package on [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dockstring):
this will automatically install the correct versions of `rdkit` and `openbabel` (which currently cannot be installed with pip).
To do this, run:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge dockstring
```

It can alternatively be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dockstring/) by running:

```bash
python3 -m pip install dockstring
```

However, this will *not* install the dependencies because `openbabel` currently cannot be installed with pip.

If you want to use dockstring for benchmarking, we recommend installing the latest version by cloning this repo:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Choose whether to install into an existing environment or create a new environment.
    - To install into a new environment, run:
      ```bash
      conda env create -f environment.yml
      conda activate dockstring
      ```
    - To install into an existing environment, simply install the desired versions of `openbabel` and `rdkit`.
1. Install the dockstring package with `pip` from this repository:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
1. Check whether the installation was successful by running a test script.
   Running without error indicates a successful install.
   ```bash
   python tutorials/simple_example.py
   ```
1. *(optional)* Install [PyMol](https://pymol.org/) for target, search box and ligand visualization:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge pymol-open-source
   ```
1. *(optional)* Check whether your local version of dockstring matches the dockstring dataset.
   This is only necessary if you plan to mix pre-computed docking scores from the dockstring dataset
   with locally-computed scores, or if you want to compare results with the dockstring paper.

   We have created a `pytest` test which randomly docks `N` molecules from the dockstring dataset
   and checks whether they match. The value of `N` can be changed by setting the environment variable
   `num_dockstring_test_molecules`. We recommend starting with `N=50`, then progressing to `N=1000`
   to do a full test. The test can be run with the following commands:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge pytest  # only if not installed already
   num_dockstring_test_molecules=1000 python -m pytest tests/test_dataset_matching.py  # change "1000" to the number you wish to dock
   ```
   If the test passes then your local version of docktring matches the dataset exactly! 🥳
   If the test does not pass, we encourage you to look how the error rate (this will be displayed in the error messages).
   If 99%+ of scores match then it is probably ok to use dockstring in the benchmarks, but there will of course be some error
   and this should be noted.

If this method of installation does not work for you, please raise a github issue and we will try to help.
