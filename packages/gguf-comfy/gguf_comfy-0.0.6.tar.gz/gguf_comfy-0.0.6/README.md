- download [flux1-dev-Q4_0.gguf](https://huggingface.co/city96/FLUX.1-dev-gguf/blob/main/flux1-dev-Q4_0.gguf) (6.32GB); pull it to ./ComfyUI/models/unet

- run the .bat file under the main directory (it will activate the py backend as well as the js frontend)

You are good to GO! (now you can run flux1 with the cheapest Nvidia GPU or merely CPU) ENJOY!
