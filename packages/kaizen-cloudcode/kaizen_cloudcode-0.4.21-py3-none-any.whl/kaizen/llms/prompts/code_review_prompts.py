## Code Quality Parameters:
When reviewing code and calculating the code quality percentage, consider:
1. Correctness: Does the code function as intended?
2. Security: Are there any potential vulnerabilities?
3. Performance: Is the code optimized for speed and resource usage?
4. Maintainability: Is the code easy to understand and modify?
5. Testability: Can the code be easily tested?
6. Code style: Does it adhere to established coding standards?
7. Documentation: Is the code well-commented and documented?
8. Error handling: Are errors and edge cases properly managed?
9. Modularity: Is the code organized into logical, reusable components?
10. Scalability: Can the code handle increased load or data volume?
11. Compliance: Does the code adhere to relevant standards and regulations?
12. Container and infrastructure best practices: If applicable, are container and IaC files following best practices?
13. AI/ML considerations: If applicable, are there concerns about bias, fairness, or explainability?
14. Accessibility: Does the code consider accessibility standards?
15. Internationalization: Is the code prepared for multiple languages and locales?


Score each parameter 1-10, then calculate the overall percentage.

## Guidelines:
- Provide specific feedback with file paths and line numbers
- Use markdown for code snippets. Make sure all code is following the original indentations.
- Merge duplicate feedback
- Check for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- Examine: syntax/logic errors, resource leaks, race conditions, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, scalability concerns, refactoring opportunities, and code duplication
- If no issues found: {{"review": []}}

## Patch Data Format:
- First column: Line number in the context
- Second column: Change type
  '[CONTEXT]': Unchanged line providing context
  '[REMOVED]': Line removed from the original code
  '[UPDATED]': Line updated or added in the new code
- Remaining columns: Code content

Example:
[LINE 23] [CONTEXT] def register_user(username, password):
[LINE 24] [REMOVED]     hashed_password = md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
[LINE 24] [UPDATED]     hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())

## Review Guidelines:
1. Analyze [REMOVED] and [UPDATED] lines for impact on code quality and functionality.
2. Use [CONTEXT] lines for understanding surrounding code.
3. Provide specific feedback with file paths and line numbers.
4. Suggest improvements for [UPDATED] lines in 'suggested_code'.
5. Examine: syntax/logic errors, resource leaks, race conditions, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, scalability, refactoring opportunities, and code duplication.
6. Consider: overall system architecture, coding standards, best practices, dependencies, performance impact, and security implications.
7. Identify code duplication and suggest refactoring.
8. Prioritize issues based on impact. Be strict; don't let issues slide.
9. If no issues found: {{"review": []}}
10. Make sure suggested_code and current_code return full functional block of code. We will use that to overwrite the current_code.

{CUSTOM_RULES}

## Additional Considerations:
- Language-specific best practices and common pitfalls
- Impact of changes on project dependencies
- Potential performance implications
- Security vulnerabilities introduced by changes
- Opportunities for code reuse and design pattern application
- Compliance with relevant standards and regulations
- Container and infrastructure best practices (if applicable)
- Accessibility and internationalization issues

Provide concrete examples or code snippets when suggesting improvements.
