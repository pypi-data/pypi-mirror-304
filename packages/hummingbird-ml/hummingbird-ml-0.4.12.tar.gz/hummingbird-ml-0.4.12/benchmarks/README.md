# Hummingbird Benchmarks

This is the main entry point for the evaluation of Hummingbird!

The benchmark is divided in three main folders:
- `trees` will allow to run all the tree-related experiments contained in section 6.1.1 in the paper **A Tensor Compiler for Unified Machine Learning Prediction Serving**. Please check the related README file for specifics.
- `operators` will allow to run experiments on operators beside trees. This is pretty much Section 6.1.2 of the paper. Again, please check the related README file for specifics.
- `pipelines` will allow to reproduce the results of section 6.3.

Take in mind that running the complete benchmark will take several days.
