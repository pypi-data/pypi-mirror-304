huey_django_orm
=
A module to use Django ORM for storage with [huey](https://pypi.org/project/huey/)

This project originally started because I wanted to just update [huey-pg](https://pypi.org/project/huey-pg/). That
proved to be more of a full rewrite than just an update.

Anyway, I didn't want to use SqliteHuey, or FileHuey, since I already have a perfectly good data store in my Django
project.

So, I took a copy of SqliteHuey, and re-implemented the class functionality using Django ORM.

Huey doesn't do anything too crazy, so it should work with any database backend supported by Django. We also don't use
any non-standard Django stuff, so it should work with any modern Django version.

## Installation

Install with pip

```bash
pip install huey-django-orm
```

### settings.py

Add to INSTALLED_APPS

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "...",
    "huey_django_orm",
    "...",
]
```

Configure Huey to use DjangoORMHuey

```python
from huey_django_orm.storage import DjangoORMHuey

HUEY = DjangoORMHuey()
```

or if you need other options

```python
HUEY = {
    "...": "...",
    'huey_class': 'huey_django_orm.storage.DjangoORMHuey',
    "......": "...",
}
```

### Run Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate huey_django_orm
```

That's it!  Now you can use Huey just like you normally would.

## Admin

Since this project is specific to Django, and will likely never be used without it, you get a few Django goodies rolled
right in.

* Each Model has a ModelAdmin
* There is an auto_now_add field in each model so we can see when an object was created within the admin
* Ordering is defined at the model level, so objects will appear in the admin in the same way they will be processed.
