# triton-transformers

This will be an implementation of  transformers using triton, 
- This is my first introduction to low-level GPU coding neurel networks i guess. 
- I will try to Also train the model not sure yet but maybe 
- As of right now I am still learning Triton 


## Training Metrics for TritonMLP on the CIFAR10 Dataset

- It seems that the training time is more or less the same pretty cool 

## Future Plans 
- I want to create a library which is be specifically for transformers vision and language
- I will be adding each components one by one
- It will take time
