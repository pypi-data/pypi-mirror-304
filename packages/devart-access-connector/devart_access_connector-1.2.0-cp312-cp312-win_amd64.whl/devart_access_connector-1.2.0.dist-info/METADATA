# Python Connector for Microsoft Access #

Python Connector for Microsoft Access is a connectivity solution for accessing
Microsoft Access databases from Python applications. It fully implements
the Python DB API 2.0 specification. The connector is distributed as a wheel
package for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Direct connection

Python offers a standard pyodbc module, which you can use to access Microsoft
Access databases through the Microsoft Access ODBC Driver. This method has
several disadvantages:
- Microsoft offers Access ODBC drivers only for the Windows platform.
- Users might experience issues opening databases created in the latest
versions of Microsoft Access.
- Users have to install either Microsoft Access or Microsoft Access Database
Engine Redistributable on their machine.
- By default, Microsoft Access is a single-user database system. An Access
database cannot be opened concurrently in multiple applications.
Our connector provides the following advantages:
- A direct access to a database without installing Microsoft Access or
Microsoft Access Database Engine Redistributable on the user's machine
- Support for all major desktop platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Support for the .mdb and .accdb file formats, including databases created
in the latest Microsoft Access versions
- A read-only multi-user mode to enable several users to read data from
a database simultaneously

## Using the connector ##

To retrieve data from a database:

Import the module.
```
import devart.access
```

Connect to a database using the `connect()` module method and obtain a `connection` object.
```
my_connection = devart.access.connect(
    Database="path_to_db"
)
```

Create a `cursor` object using the `cursor()` connection method.
```
my_cursor = my_connection.cursor()
```

Execute the SQL statement using the `execute()` cursor method.
```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
```

Retrieve the result set using one of the `fetch*()` cursor methods.
```
for row in my_cursor.fetchall(): 
    print(row)
```
