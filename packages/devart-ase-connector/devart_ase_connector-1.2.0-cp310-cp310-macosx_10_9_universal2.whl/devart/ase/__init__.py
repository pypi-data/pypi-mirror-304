"""
Python Connector for ASE is a connectivity solution for accessing ASE
databases from Python applications. It fully implements the Python DB API 2.0
specification. The connector is distributed as a wheel package for Windows,
macOS, and Linux.
 
Direct connection

    The connector enables you to establish a direct connection to ASE from
    a Python application via TCP/IP, eliminating the need for the database client
    library. A direct connection increases the speed of data transmission between
    the application and ASE database server. It also streamlines the deployment
    process since you don't have to distribute any client libraries with
    the application.
 
Secure communication

    The connector supports encrypted communications using SSL/TLS, SSH tunneling,
    and HTTP/HTTPS tunneling.

Version: 1.2.0
