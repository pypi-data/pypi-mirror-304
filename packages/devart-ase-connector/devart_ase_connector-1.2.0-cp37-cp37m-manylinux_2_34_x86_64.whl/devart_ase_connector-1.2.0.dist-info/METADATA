# Python Connector for ASE #

Python Connector for ASE is a connectivity solution for accessing ASE
databases from Python applications. It fully implements the Python DB API 2.0
specification. The connector is distributed as a wheel package for Windows,
macOS, and Linux.

Direct connection

The connector enables you to establish a direct connection to ASE from
a Python application via TCP/IP, eliminating the need for the database client
library. A direct connection increases the speed of data transmission between
the application and ASE database server. It also streamlines the deployment
process since you don't have to distribute any client libraries with
the application.

Secure communication

The connector supports encrypted communications using SSL/TLS, SSH tunneling,
and HTTP/HTTPS tunneling.

## Using the connector ##

To retrieve data from a database:

Import the module.
```
import devart.ase
```

Connect to a database using the `connect()` module method and obtain a `connection` object.
```
my_connection = devart.ase.connect(
    Server="your_server",
    Database="your_database",
    UserId="your_username",
    Password="your_password"
)
```

Create a `cursor` object using the `cursor()` connection method.
```
my_cursor = my_connection.cursor()
```

Execute the SQL statement using the `execute()` cursor method.
```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
```

Retrieve the result set using one of the `fetch*()` cursor methods.
```
for row in my_cursor.fetchall(): 
    print(row)
```
