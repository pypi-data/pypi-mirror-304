# Python Connector for SQL Server #

Python Connector for SQL Server is a connectivity solution for accessing SQL
Server databases from Python applications. It fully implements the Python DB
API 2.0 specification. The connector is distributed as a wheel package
for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Direct connection

The connector enables you to establish a direct connection to SQL Server from
a Python application via TCP/IP, eliminating the need for the database client
library. A direct connection increases the speed of data transmission between
the application and SQL Server database server. It also streamlines
the deployment process since you don't have to distribute any client
libraries with the application.

Secure communication

The connector supports encrypted communications using SSL/TLS, SSH tunneling,
and HTTP/HTTPS tunneling.

## Using the connector ##

To retrieve data from a database:

Import the module.
```
import devart.sqlserver
```

Connect to a database using the `connect()` module method and obtain a `connection` object: 
If you're using mixed mode authentication:
```
my_connection = devart.sqlserver.connect("[!ConnectionString]")
```
If you're using Windows authentication:
```
my_connection = devart.sqlserver.connect("Authentication=Windows;Server=your_server;Database=your_database")
```

Create a `cursor` object using the `cursor()` connection method.
```
my_cursor = my_connection.cursor()
```

Execute the SQL statement using the `execute()` cursor method.
```
my_cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
```

Retrieve the result set using one of the `fetch*()` cursor methods.
```
for row in my_cursor.fetchall(): 
    print(row)
```
