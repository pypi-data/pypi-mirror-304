**SciCookie** is a project template designed to simplify scientific Python
project creation. It provides an initial structure with recommended tools,
workflows, and industry best practices, saving developers time and effort. Built
upon the PyOpenSci recommendations, it offers a foundation that adheres to
scientific Python standards while remaining customizable to specific project
needs.

- [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scicookie/)
- [License (BSD)](https://github.com/osl-incubator/scicookie/blob/main/LICENSE)

### Key Features:

- **Project Structure:** Choose between "src" (code in a subdirectory) and
  "flat" (all files in the top-level directory) layouts.
- **Packaging & Dependencies:** Supports Poetry, Flit, meson-python, setuptools,
  PDM, Hatch, Maturin, scikit-build-core, Pixi, or setuptools + pybind11 for
  flexible build systems.
- **Testing & Linting:** Integrates with pytest, hypothesis, black
  (auto-formatting), bandit (security), pydocstyle (documentation style),
  vulture (unused code detection), and McCabe (cyclomatic complexity analysis)
  for a robust development environment.
- **Version Control & Automation:** Includes initial git integration, conda
  (base environment) support, pre-commit hooks, continuous integration with
  GitHub Actions, and release workflows with semantic-release.
- **Documentation:** Offers options for mkdocs, sphinx-rst, sphinx-myst,
  jupyter-book or quarto documentation generation.
- **Containerization:** Provides the ability to add initial files for running
  and managing containers using Docker or Podman.

### Benefits:

- **Reduces boilerplate code:** SciCookie eliminates the need to write
  repetitive project setup code, allowing developers to focus on core
  functionality.
- **Ensures consistency:** Enforces a standardized structure, promoting code
  maintainability and collaboration.
- **Adheres to best practices:** Leverages PyOpenSci recommendations for
  efficient scientific Python development.
- **Improves code quality:** Integrates with various testing and linting tools
  for better code hygiene.
- **Automates workflows:** Streamlines processes like documentation generation,
  version control, and continuous integration.

### Getting Started:

**Prerequisites**

- Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by
  running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal. If you
  don't have it, download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

**Installation**

- Install Cookiecutter (if not already installed): Open your terminal and run
  the following command: `pip install scicookie`

**Project Creation**

1. Navigate to your desired project directory: Use the `cd` command to navigate
   to the directory where you want to create your new Python package project.
   For example: `cd ~/dev/my-python-projects` (Replace
   `~/dev/my-python-projects` with your preferred directory path.)

2. Generate the project using SciCookie: Once you're in your desired directory,
   run the following command to generate a new Python package project using
   SciCookie: `scicookie`

_(SciCookie will create a new directory structure for your project, including
files and folders commonly used in scientific Python projects. You can now start
editing and customizing your project to fit your specific needs.)_

##### _Alternatively_

- Generate the project using SciCookie (with optional OSL profile):
  `scicookie --profile osl`

_(The `--profile osl` flag allows you to generate the project with the OSL
recommended configuration. If omitted, the default SciCookie profile will be
used.)_
